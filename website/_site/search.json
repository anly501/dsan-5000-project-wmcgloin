    "text": "Hello!\nHello and welcome to my website! My name is Billy and I am a graduate student at Georgetown University. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science and Analytics and will use this website as a place to display my work. I hope you find my work insightful and enjoy your time on my website!\n\n\nGrowing Up\nI grew up in Scotch Plains, New Jersey along with my two sisters, Melissa and Jessica. We are triplets! Below is a picture of me with my family and another of our dog Roxie.\n\n \n\n\n\nEducation\nI graduated from Villanova University in 2021 with an Honors Degree Double Major in Economics and Business Analytics along with a PPE (Politics, Philosophy, & Economics) Concentration and Political Science minor. I absolutely loved my time at Villanova between the academics, friendships, the school winning the NCAA Championship and more!. As an undergrad, I was involved in a number of student organizations, including the Blue Key Society, where I served as a tour guide for undergraduate admissions. I also organized accepted students days for the university.\nOne of the best experiences I had during college was studying abroad. In 2019, I participated in the Institute of Politics and Economics Program at the University of Cambridge where I took a number of economic classes and study international relations and history. Seeing how these subject matters interact with analytics truly fascinated me, which is one reason why I am pursuing an advanced degree in data science. I am extremely excited to continue my education and pursue a masters degree in data science!\n\n\nTop Shelf Designs, LLC\nDuring my senior year at Villanova, I had the opportunity to start my own business with my sisters! Our business, Top Shelf Designs, LLC, is a retail business that designs, builds, and sells college dorm shelving units to help students maximize their space. Being an entrepreneur has been an incredibly rewarding journey thus far, and I am eager to see where it takes us. Here is a link to our website!\n\n\nHobbies\nI’m an avid sports fan, and love watching the New York Yankees, Villanova basketball, and NY Giants. Unfortunately, none of my teams have been doing too well lately, but I’m hoping the Giants can turn it around this season! I’m fascinated by how analytics is being used to transform the sports landscape - even across college sports! While at Villanova, I researched the Houston Astros Cheating Scandal. I would love to go back and take an even deeper dive into the subject one day!\nI love music - you can often find me with headphones or earbuds in while doing work or exploring the DC area! Additionally, I find playing instruments to be a great creative outlet after a long day of work. I grew up taking piano lessons and during COVID started to teach myself how to play the guitar!\nWhenever I have the chance, I try to travel. Wile abroad, I was lucky enough to travel to a few places in Europe. My favorite spot has to be Italy - from the history and culture to the food, wine, and sports, I am counting down the days until I can go back.\nFinally, I thoroughly enjoy books, movies, video games in addition to fun, in-person experiences. Lately, I’ve been exploring the DC area which I am loving so far! If you have any recommendations - please let me know! I’m alwyas willing to try something new!\n\n\nGeneral Info (inc. netID)\n\n\n\nname\nBilly McGloin\n\n\nGU netID\nwtm30\n\n\nLinkedIn\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\nJokes\nI always like to have a laugh so below are some jokes I hope you’ll enjoy!\n\nWebsite Jokes\n\nWhat do you call a doctor who fixes websites? A URL-ologist.\nWebsites use cookies to improve performance. I do the same.\nWhat website has the information on all DJs?

    "text": "Prior Research\nThe initial investigation into this topic Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky (1985) was published in 1985. It analyzed assorted data, including professional basketball field goal data from the 1980-1981 season, professional basketball free-throw data from the 1980-1982 seasons, and a controlled shooting experiment. While the study found that over 91% of fans agreed that a player has a better chance of making a shot after having just made his last two or three shots than he does after having just missed his last two or three shots, none of their data showed any evidence of this phenomenon. Instead, Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky (1985) argued that there is a wide-spread misperception of random sequences:\n\nPeople’s intuitive conceptions of randomness depart systematically from the laws of chance. It appears that people expect the essential characteristics of a chance process to be represented not only globally in the entire sequences, but also locally, in each of its parts. For instance, people expect even short sequences of heads and tails to reflect the fairness of a coin and contain roughly 50% heads and 50% tails. This conception of chance has been described as a ‘belief in the law of small numbers’ according to which the law of large numbers applies to small samples as well. A locally representative sequence, however, deviates systematically from chance expectation: It contains too many alternations and not enough long runs.\n\nBar-Eli, Avugos, and Raab (2006) published a review and critique of 20 years of “hot hand” research in 2006. This paper reviewed the Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky (1985) study in addition to subsequent research that used data from various sports including basketball, baseball, golf, darts, tennis, bowling, and more. Baseball and basketball studies dominate the literature on this subject, yet the strongest support for the “hot hand” can be found in more individual sports such as horseshoe pitching and tennis.\n\nDemonstrations of hot hands per se are rare and often weak, due to various reasons: using and unrealistic model and questionable data, setting questionable definitions for hot and cold players, relating streakiness to difficulty of task, combining and analyzing data of all players a as a group, and other constraints related to the kind of sport studied.\n\nIn the end, this study found that the question remains unresolved.  MORE RESEARCH TO COME"
