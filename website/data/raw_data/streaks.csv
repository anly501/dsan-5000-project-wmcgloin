Every year at the beginning of the season I put together a [survival guide for new and returning fans](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/11i01bg/the_2023_rbaseball_season_survival_guide/), and with the likely renewed interest that the postseason brings along with new rules that may be enticing some new viewers, I thought I would put together this quick little Postseason supplement to help out those paying close attention for the first time this year. I have included the rule changes for 2023 (pretty widespread acceptance and approval from fans), a TV guide along with some streaming service options, as well as a quick guide to all 12 teams in the playoff field. Hopefully this is enough of a guide to give you an idea of how/where to watch as well as a general idea of the storylines coming into the playoffs, and maybe give you a team to root for if yours is already eliminated.

#Rule Changes for 2023:

 - Batters must be in the box ready with at least 8 seconds remaining. Penalty: Automatic Strike
 - Batters allowed one time out per plate appearance.
 - Pitchers may call pitches using pitch com.
 - Pitchers are allowed two free pick offs attempts or step offs per plate appearance. On subsequent pick off attempts either an out must be made, or the runners advance one base for free. If runners advance, the free pick off/step offs reset.
 - Ban on certain shifts: teams must have two players on the left and right sides of second base on the infield, all four must have feet on infield dirt.
 - Bases have been enlarged from 15 inches on each side to 18 inches on each side.
 - No automatic runner for the playoffs (not a change, just thought it worth emphasizing)

# Teams

**Toronto Blue Jays - AL Wild Card 3**

 - Record: 89-73
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1993
 - Last World Series Win: 1993
 - First Opponent: Minnesota Twins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.5%

The only non-American team are back in the playoffs after surviving a tough AL East. The team known as the Baby Birds aren't exactly babies anymore with their lineup of players with Major League dads all having a few years of experience at this point. Vlad Jr. took a minor step back this year but Brandon Belt's resurgence at age 35 has buoyed a solid offence. The Jays will look to AL Strike Out leader Kevin Gausman to get them out to a good start with the rest of the rotation and bullpen providing an excellent follow up.

**Texas Rangers - AL Wild Card 2**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2016
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2011
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1961, moved to Texas 1972)
 - First Opponent: Tampa Bay Rays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 4.7%

The Rangers are looking to rebound from a cool finish to the season - a hot start that led to a 6 game lead for the division in June fell to a tough division race in August before a seeming resurgence gave them a 2.5 game lead with 4 games left to play that turned into a second place finish. For Rangers fandom, this is about exorcising playoff demons that have haunted them since being one strike away twice in 2011, the team hasn't won a playoff series since. The Rangers star has been Corey Seager who slashed a ridiculous .327/.390/.623 over the season to bounce back from a disappointing 2021 that looked like he wouldn't be worth the massive contract he got.

**Tampa Bay Rays - AL Wild Card 1**

 - Record: 99-63
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1998)
 - First Opponent: Texas Rangers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.0%

The Rays were the hottest team in baseball to start the season sitting at 23-6 at the end of April. A July slump of 8-16 cost the team the division, but the Rays rebounded to finish the year with a good record. Next man up has been the name of the game as injuries (and a major legal scandal of star which we won't get into) have proven that the Rays can just pull someone up from the minors to plug into whatever gaps they have. When healthy almost every bat in the lineup is well above average, with first baseman Yandy Diaz having the biggest bat of them all. The team is also fleet of feet, 2nd in the AL in stolen bases with 160 led by Josh Lowe's 32. And with news of a new stadium on the horizon that keeps the team in Tampa Bay area (albeit in St. Pete), expect fans to be fully behind the team. Despite all that, all eyes will likely be on 2020 breakout star and 2023 World Baseball Classic hero Randy Arozarena who seems to always deliver when the moment is big.

**Minnesota Twins - AL Central Champions**

 - Record: 87-75
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1991
 - Last World Series Win: 1991
 - First Opponent: Toronto Blue Jays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 2.0%


The Twins coasted through most of September after taking 2 of 3 from the Guardians at the beginning of the month to solidify their hold on the worst division in baseball and despite that come into the wild card round with some injury questions. Superstar shortstop Carlos Correa (who has had a disappointing year at the plate) hasn't played in over a week, electric center fielder Byron Buxton (who is made of glass and also has had a disappointing year at the plate) hasn't played since August 1st, and rookie grand slam sensation Royce Lewis (who may also be made of glass) tweaked a hamstring the second to last week of the season and may be relegated to DH only. On the flip side, the bullpen gained back some of it's best arms late with returns from the IL from Brock Stewart, Caleb Thielbar, and Chris Paddack - along with Kenta Maeda moving to the pen means the bullpen should be better than the season numbers indicate. With all of that said, those storylines take a back seat to the big one - the franchise is on an 18 game playoff losing streak, the longest in professional sport history.

**Houston Astros - AL West Champions**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Win: 2022
 - First Opponent: Winner of Blue Jays/Twins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 19.8%


The Astros snatched the division championship on the last day of the season, disappointing millions of people who are still upset about the 2017 sign stealing scandal and/or are just tired of seeing the Astros in the playoffs. Houston is the current AL dynasty and has played in the last 6 ALCSs and 3 of the last 6 World Series. 2023 was the worst regular season for the team since the 2016 season, but the biggest bats and hardest throwers from last year's championship team are back this year and still major threats even with some minor steps back statistically. Don't expect Yordon Alvarez to get a pitch with hit with runners in scoring position if the opposing team wants to win.

**Baltimore Orioles - AL East Champions**

 - Record: 101-61
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2016
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1983
 - Last World Series Win: 1983
 - First Opponent: Winner of Rangers/Rays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.3%

The breakout team of the year - while many thought they arrived two years early last year in their surprise winning season following a 110 loss 2021, most thought they would take a minor step forward and 2024 would be the real deal. The Orioles players did not agree. Excellent bullpen usage and key hits kept this team cruising through the year. Solid hitters up and down the lineup without elite mashers (though Adley Rutschman does set a high bar for a catcher), Kyle Bradish anchors a solid rotation - the team is an exemplary example of the team as a whole being more than the sum of the parts. The team is young (only one player over the age of 30 played in 100 games), hungry, and ready to prove that this team is set to take over the AL for years to come.

**Arizona Diamondbacks - NL Wild Card 3**

 - Record: 84-78
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2017
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2001
 - Last World Series Win: 2001
 - First Opponent: Milwaukee Brewers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 3.6%

A likely Rookie of the Year campaign from Corbin Carroll and great years from starters Merrill Kelly and Zac Gallen was enough to push the Diamondbacks into the postseason for the first time since 2017. The team is only two years removed from a disastrous 110 loss season and while they aren't nearly to the level of their 2021 AL counterpart Orioles, the team still has the pieces to make some noise. Look for lots of movement on the basepaths from the D-Backs, they finished second in baseball in stolen bases and the most of anyone in the playoff field. 

**Miami Marlins - NL Wild Card 2**

 - Record: 84-77
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2003
 - Last World Series Win: 2003
 - First Opponent: Philadelphia Phillies
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 2.3%

The Marlins haven't had a winning season in a full year since 2009, and their only playoff appearance since their 2003 World Series run was in the covid shortened 2020 season. The offense is Luis Arraez hitting for average like no one else, and Jorge Soler providing the power, with a solid rotation that keeps them in games. They are the only playoff team with a negative run differential and are looking to show that winning close games is a skill that can translate to the postseason. Despite the potential slights, major credit needs to be given to GM Kim Ng, the first female GM in major North American professional sports, for finding the pieces to survive a division with the buzzsaw Braves and find a way into the playoffs.

**Philadelphia Phillies - NL Wild Card 1**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Win: 2008
 - First Opponent: Miami Marlins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.9%

The 2022 NL Champions and World Series runner ups knew it would be a tough road in the division with the Braves, but they managed to push their way through to a 90 win season and snatch the top wild card spot. After an atrocious start to the season, Trea Turner has turned it around to close out the year, and Bryce Harper is ready to lead this team in another deep postseason run. Of course, it'd be remiss to talk about the Phillies without talking about one of the more interesting stat lines in baseball - Kyle Schwarber batting .197 and still managed to be a major offensive plus with 47 homers and 126 walks. Prime time coverage will be on Philly during the wild card round, and the stadium is set to be just as raucous as last year.

**Milwaukee Brewers - NL Central Champions**

 - Record: 92-70
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2021
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1982
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1969, moved to Milwaukee 1970)
 - First Opponent: Arizona Diamondbacks
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 3.9%

Pitching is the name of the game for the Brewers with a stellar bullpen and a playoff rotation of sub 4 ERA pitchers - they have the lowest runs allowed per game of playoff teams. Christian Yelich bounced back from a poor showing in 2022 to be above average, though not nearly to his elite levels of prior years, and William Contreres brought production from behind the dish. Surprisingly, the main characters of this team's run aren't the ones on the field, though. Manager Craig Counsell has been at the helm since 2015 and is the winningest manager in team history and one of the most respected managers in the game, but with his contract up at the end of the year it sounds like he's ready to take a step back and ride off into the sunset. In addition, long time announcer Bob Uecker turns 90 this offseason and there are always question of how long he'll be able to continue. This gives some added urgency to win now for a city that hasn't seen a World Series win since the 1957 Braves.

**Los Angeles Dodgers - NL West Champions**

 - Record: 100-62
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Win: 2020
 - First Opponent: Winner of Diamondbacks/Brewers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 17.6%

The Dodgers are riding into their 11th straight postseason with their 5th 100 win season in that time (6th if you include the 100+ win pace shortened 2020). Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman would with MVP favorites if not for a certain Braves player, and Clayton Kershaw is still throwing to a sub 3 ERA. The team has the pieces and playoff experience to make a deep run - which we have said about them for the last decade. Yet the only ring in that time was in the shortened 2020 season - a asterisk in some people's eyes that the team and fanbase is ready shake with a title this year.

**Atlanta Braves - NL East Champions**

 - Record: 104-58
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2021
 - Last World Series Win: 2021
 - First Opponent: Winner of Marlins/Phillies
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 20.4%

They built a deathstar by locking up young talent on long term contracts, they added the best catcher on the market this year, and then they sat back and watched Ronald Acuna Jr. use and abuse the new rules to steal 73 bases (the most in a single season since 2007) to go with a 41 home run campaign. The team tied the single season team record for home runs in a season with 307 with a team slugging over .500. The Atlanta Braves are easily the favorites to win the 2023 World Series and have all the pieces to keep their division titles streak going beyond the 6 they currently have.","baseball",68,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/16xwx9z/the_2023_mlb_playoffs_survival_guide/"

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| This week was nothing special for [the Rays](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/038/456/669/original/noel-bellett-project-mantaray-gif-01.gif?1623153356) as they kept up their normal ~.800 win percentage. Just your normal, [pimping a putout](https://www.mlb.com/video/chase-anderson-in-play-out-s-to-bryan-reynolds-rebasl), walking off the Yankees, sweeping the best NL team, warm water kind of week. I'm sure you're familiar. This week is a full slate against the AL East, let's hope the trends continue. |**28-7**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 6-2 including series wins against the Mets and the Orioles. Really nice week. Getting healthier and healthier. This team can win in so many ways. We get a couple of rest days this week, which come at a good time with multiple players returning from the IL. Keep it going. |**24-11**
**3**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+6**|  |**21-14**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| The offense is going to win a lot of games for the club this year. The starting pitchers are going to win a lot of games for the club this year. The bullpen is going to blow a lot of those games this year. We're having fun though. |**20-13**
**5**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**| This'll be short, as I'm in Hawaii for my birthday. We did real, real bad against the Red Sox and real, real good against the Pirates. Matt Chapman. Chris Bassitt. Whit Merrifield. Baseball. Mahalo.  |**21-14**
**6**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+1**| I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the games over the weekend against the Braves. Won the first one and seriously had a chance to win the next two. Bullpen was a little off and some mistakes were made, however having the chance to win 3 games in Atlanta against a really good team shows the Orioles might be for real after all. They are still, let's say, one year ahead of schedule, so there are still a lot of growing pains. Hitting with runners in scoring position is not consistent, there are 3 catchers on the roster for some reason and there is a huge logjam in the infield. I would think the biggest concern right now is Gunnar Henderson. The consensus pre-season ROTY favorite in the AL is batting .176 in 29 games. Yes, he walks, and his defense is good, but right now he looks lost at the plate. There are other prospects crushing it in AAA and the Cardinals sent Jordan Walker down to work things out and he was hitting .274. Look he is 21 years old, and the game is hard. It wouldn't be the worst thing if he gets sent down to figure a couple of things out. Big series against Tampa Bay starts today. |**22-12**
**7**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+11**| Well, losing to the Phillies the day before power rankings makes this a bit less sweet, but still FUCK THAT 8 GAME WIN STREAK INCLUDING A SWEEP OF TORONTO LETS GOOOOO! Somehow playing center field for Boston bestows the power of baseball gods onto whatever old player you throw out there. 34 year old Adam Duvall? 1.030 slugging in 37 PAs. Formerly-hyped-but-now-kinda-washed prospect Jarren Duran? Called up and immediately starts raking in hits, .366 average in 20 games. Hopefully we can keep the momentum rolling for a two game set in Atlanta. |**21-15**
**8**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-4**| Milwaukee has lost 6 of the previous 7 games they've played, yet somehow they are still only 0.5 games out of first.  I'm definitely scratching my head.     Rookie 2B Brice Turang has haad a heck of a week slashing .467/.556/.533 and Christian Yelich might be making me eat a bit of crow hitting .308 since I mentioned him last week. |**19-15**
**9**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**|  |**19-16**
**10**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-2**| It's crazy that the Astros just suddenly stopped playing on Saturday night and the game was canceled. Don't think that's ever happened before. The team doesn't look too great right now and pitching injuries continue to pile up, with Luis Garcia as the latest victim. Hope is on the horizon, though: Brantley and McCormick are expected back this week, and Altuve is apparently close to starting a rehab assignment.  |**17-17**
**11**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+2**| As fun as it was to see Tatis bop two homers off Kershaw on Friday, its hard to call the series anything but a disappointment, losing 2 / 3 vs LA, with Hader giving up the game tying homer to Mookie Betts, and the Pads losing in the 10th. Still, Im squinting my eyes a bit, and noticing that over the last two weeks; Manny has an Ops of .970, Tatis has been doing well since hes started the season, and even Cronenworths bat has picked up a bit in the same time frame. Its not great to be just in the middle of the pack right now, but I still think theres plenty of room for optimism. Its gonna take a bit before the allure of getting to watch Bogaerts, Tatis, Manny, and Soto all in the same lineup wear off.  |**18-17**
**12**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-6**| The Pirates may be improved from 2022, but they're not ready to hang with MLB's best teams quite yet. After scoring 16 runs in a game against the Nationals on April 29, the Pirates have scored a total of 9 runs since then  and the pitching and defense haven't been so hot either. Sweeps at the hands of the Rays and Blue Jays make it 7 straight losses for the Bucs, and I shudder to think how many games this team would've lost the last couple of years had they played in the AL East.   |**20-15**
**13**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+3**| After sweeping a rather hapless Cardinals team, the Angels scored some runs against the Rangers, but gave up a lot more. They allowed 13 runs in the 7th inning or later in the series, a bit more specifically. While the bullpen has settled in some, posting the 9th best ERA in baseball among bullpens, they are also 9th in baseball in meltdowns. It's clear the team could use another arm - or two with the injuries - to really shore things up.  |**19-16**
**14**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had a good week by the W/L numbers, but failed to capitalize against a very bad Washington team and let a sweep slip through the fingers. The pitching continues to be an issue.  |**19-15**
**15**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-3**| A series win in Tampa would have been huge for a struggling Yankees team, and it was surprisingly a very real possibility. Tampas a tough team to beat pepper in some classic Aaron Boone bullpen bungling, a couple costly errors, and the first bad start of Coles season, and youll drop *at least* 2/3 every time. All that aside, the offense actually showed flashes of competency this week. With Judge due back Tuesday, hopefully this is a get right series vs. Oakland.  |**18-17**
**16**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**|  |**17-17**
**17**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-6**| The Mets have played 8 times since my last update and lost 6 times, including a sweep in Detroit and a series loss against the Rockies at home. They are now under .500. Verlander had a solid Mets debut but Scherzer was absolutely torched in his return from suspension - bumping his ERA up to 5.56 on the year. The team heads into another week that should be easy on paper - with series against the Reds and Nationals - if they once again fail to deliver, they'll be looking even more like paper tigers than they already do. |**17-18**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+2**| A 5-1 week vs. two division rivals and the Mariners are finally back to .500 - hopefully a good sign of things to come. Bryce Miller is here and doing pretty great thus far, and the team is slowly starting to pick up their hitting. Oh, and the City Connect unis are out now, I guess (though really they should just make the Turn Ahead the Clock unis a permanent fixture.) Up next: 3 vs. Walker, Texas Rangers, 3 @ Beisbolcats |**17-17**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| Bryce Harper's return saw the move to have Kyle Schwarber hit lead-off like he did in the postseason last year. He proceeded to go 0-19 as the Phillies lost their next 4 to cap a 6 game losing streak. Yay. On the plus side, Stott was moved back to leadoff on Sunday and the Phillies won while Schwarber went 2-3 with a home run. Baseball. Bryce Harper is back and better than ever, and Ranger Suarez should be returning this week. The pitching was atrocious, giving up 36 runs in a 3 game series to the Dodgers while bouncing back for 13 in 3 against the Red Sox. Hopefully it's just a blip in what's been a great season for the bullpen so far, but the starters continue to struggle. Even with Suarez returning and Painter potentially later in the season, the Phillies likely need starting pitching help more than anything. This week: a short two game series against the Blue Jays at home before heading to Coors for 3. Go Sixers |**16-19**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-1**| The Guardians actually won a series this week! I'm hoping this is the beginning of things turning around, but I am still concerned. We aren't getting enough hits or runs, and the pitchers have given up a lot of hits and runs. Crap, that sounded bad. We also blow early leads a lot. I probably shouldn't be complaining. |**16-18**
**21**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+2**| The Giants took a series @ Houston and vs the Brewers, turning in what was easily the best week of the year. You are allowed to feel happy this Monday and I encourage it because it sounds more fun than hungover which I currently am. |**15-18**
**22**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| Im sick and tired of the marlins playing the braves and mets. The braves smacked us yet again and we dropped a series to the cubs after winning a series against chitown last week in miami. thankfully, sandy seems to be trending back up and we know which bullpen arms are gonna be dependable or not. Jazz is somewhat concerning at the plate to start the season but there is plenty of baseball left this year. We got 3 against the sneks in the desert and 3 at home against the reds this week. |**17-18**
**23**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+3**| Interesting development yesterday as the Tigers demoted Spencer Turnbull, who's struggled to find his footing coming back from Tommy John surgery. This streaky team (seriously, look at their game log) has had a few more ups than downs recently and is surprisingly sitting in the middle of the AL Central, 3 games out of first place (don't expect this to continue). Last week was fun watching the returns- and losses- of Verlander and Scherzer to CoPa while wearing the wrong colors. This week: 3 at CLE, 3 vs. SEA. |**15-18**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-2**| The Cards went 1-5, dodging 3 straight sweeps. Sure, they could still turn it around. YCPB. But the situation with Contreras while the team is 11-24 has provided final clarity on John Mozeliak. He's no savant doing his best with what ownership gives him. He's the rot at the core, surviving off a decade of blind luck and generational talents compensating for his endless mistakes. Matheny, Shildt, Marmol. What's the common factor? It's John Mozeliak. Time's up. He and everyone like him in the org must go. |**11-24**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**-1**| Sometimes I just want to watch baseball and have fun. You know, waking up like this every day can be stress inducing, I just want to drag myself out of bed half asleep and go to work to suffer through a miserable day of mediocrity and come home to watch some fun baseball to unwind. That's all I want. But nooooooo, I had to be unfortunate enough to become a Reds fan so I'm just constantly miserable. Sometimes life just works out that way huh? Sometimes you're sitting at a red light and the radio is playing some s**t song from someone you've never heard of named Lexi Nova or something and you think ""Gee this sounds terrible, who would ever listen to this"" and you look around and see a bunch of young people nodding their head to rhythem in the surrounding cars, so oh I guess that's who listens to it, what do they understand about it that I don't? And the song is over after like 2 verses because those same young people need it to make some dumb tik tok or whatever and good god I've been sitting at this red light for like 5 minutes now there's nothing coming why hasn't it turned green yet I'm gonna be late to work. Sometimes life just works that way. You could be sitting at home with the wife and you're arguing because her Dad is being a dick about who's gonna get the house between his 4 children and I personally don't care because his house is like 70 years old and the amount of money to fix it to modern standards is gonna basically the same if we were to just remodel it entirely so what's even the point anyway? And my wife's like ""You never even liked my dad all that much"" which yeah that's partially true, but I pretended because I loved her, and I'm all like ""This isn't about your dad, I'm not sure why you're upset"" and then she tells me ""You've been way too distant, I want you back"". You know sometimes life just works out like that, you're stuck in a soul draining job because you were too lazy to get good grades in high school and you got stuck doing GEDs at a community college that you're now thousands of dollar in debt to. Sometimes it just works like that, and you keep arguing with the wife about how unhappy you are and maybe you should take some time to think things over, we married way too young anyway, I missed out on my prime years because I got in too deep in this relationship which was flawed from the beginning because of our age and now we have a kid I barely spend time with and it's falling apart and I JUST WANT TO RELAX. She storms off to go stay at her Dad's for a bit, I just want to have fun so I turn on the Reds game and they're losing 17-4 Goddammit, f**k f**k f**k. F***k.  |**14-20**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Entering 2023 with a career ERA above 5 is usually not a good sign but Josiah Gray is poving that number to be his past. Gray is currently sporting a 3.03ERA and while his most recent outing at Arizona wasn't the most sparkling of turns (5IP, 3ER), he had 3 Quality Starts in April and has lowered his barrel % to 6.3% (lower than league average 6.8%). He's throwing his slider more and inducing 42% ground balls, much closer to the league average than his previous years in the low 30%. |**14-20**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The Rockies went 5-1 this week, sweeping the Brewers and taking 2 of 3 from the Mets, which is good on paper.  This is kind of my least favorite type of week for the current brand of Rockies, because it inevitably means that my dad is going to call me and say something like, ""They're getting hot, maybe they have a chance!"" and I have to pretend like they do until they go on their next .200 winning percentage week and dash his hopes. |**14-21**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| This week marked the first time the White Sox won 2 games in a row this year and also marked their first series win. They actually won both series this week. Despite that and despite the 17-4 win on Sunday, they are still 11 games below .500 with a run differential of -54. Probably not ideal for a team that was supposed to be in the middle of their contention window. |**12-23**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| John Sherman wants tax dollars for a new stadium, but can't even field a team that can win a series against the A's. The fucking A's. A team whose ownership doesn't give a fuck and isn't trying took two of three from KC. I'd say that's the nadir of the season, but it'll probably get worse. |**9-26**

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**+6**| Remember last year when the Rays had a disappointing wild card round where offense was a myth? Now that team is healthy and balling the fuck out. Wander decided to use his power stroke, NUKE RALEY has been out here supporting his 2.4 kids, the dawg Brandon Lowe (pronounced Lowe) has returned, Randy is in full confidence mode, Isaac is defying gravity, and really everyone is looking fantastic. Our pitching has been lights out with only 1 notable weak point, which will get filled in by some guy named Ty Glas-Steagall or something. The Rays have entered the realm of 1800s comparisons, even accusations of including barnstorming stats, but who cares! The water is the perfect temperature right now, why wouldn't you dive in? |**9-0**
**2**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+1**| Judge hates the Os, Stanton hates baseballs, the Bombers apparently like stealing bases, and everybody loves Franchy (who wouldve thought?). Pitching looked rock solid again this week (if your name isnt Clarke Schmidt) with two more good starts from Cole and Nestor, plus a couple of filthy outings from Clay Holmes. If the Yanks keep winning 2/3 all year, thats 108 wins which should be more than good enough to grab the wildcard behind the 162-0 Rays. |**6-3**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-1**| After a hot start, the Braves ran into a bit of a buzzsaw in the Padres that spolied the home opening series. It also doesn't help that our Cy Young candidate, last year's Rookie of the Year, closer and our best offensive catcher (so far) are all on the IL. Not to mention Kyle Wright and Mike Soroka who are still recovering. If we can shake off the injury bug, we will be fine. Hopefully 2 series with the Reds and then the Royals will be just what the doctor ordered. |**6-4**
**4**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| While many fans were hopeful that Xander Boagarts would hit the ground running, his early exploits may not be as surprising as the Padres debuts of both Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha. Xander is rocking an ops over 1000, while both of those pitchers are rocking eras 3 and under. Its certainly been needed, as Musgrove is still on the mend, and the Padres have more tough competition ahead versus the Mets and BrewCrew. |**6-4**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| The Dodgers allowed double digit runs only twice in the entire 2022 season. They allowed double digit runs in back to back games against the D-Backs to close this week (which for the record, is partly because Arizona actually looks really good, but still). Considering how much I yammered on about pitching being the backbone of the Dodgers' success last week, I really hope this is just a dumb baseball outlier stat. Still, despite it ending on a sour note, a 3-3 week is not worth burning everything down over. We're still very, very early in the season folks, I will not be jumping to any early conclusions other than declaring James Outman to be the reincarnation of Mickey Mantle.  |**5-5**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-5**| Weird week for the Astros. The absence of Altuve and Brantley is certainly being felt and the pitching just hasn't been as sharp as we're used to, aside from Hunter Brown's fantastic performance today against the Twins. Still too early for any major shakeups, though I know half the fanbase is clamoring for Jake Meyers' head on a stick any time he appears in the lineup - especially over Chas McCormick. Also, can someone tell Jeremy Pena we are playing the Yankees or Phillies? Thanks.  |**4-6**
**7**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+6**| I certainly didn't expect to see Milwaukee sweep the Mets (who happen to have triple the total payroll) and taking 2/3 from St Louis is always a happy day for Brewers fans.    The Jesse Winker/Kolten Wong trade is showing really well for Milwaukee to start the season and 3B Brian Anderson is one of the hottest hitters in the NL so far. |**7-2**
**8**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| We need to talk about Jose. After a horribly disappointing '22, Berrios has started '23 with two losses, an 11.17 ERA, 15 hits, all in only 9.2 innings of work. And he's only 2 years into a 7-year deal. This is not great, Bob. Thankfully, the rest of the rotation has mostly rebounded after a rough first go-round, with Manoah and Gausman looking very sharp in games in KC and LAA (I will have nightmares for a long time of Trout arm-muscling massive dingers). Kikuchi still makes you sweat when he's bad, so TBD on him, and our bullpen is still capable of snatching hope away in an instant, like a scientifically enhanced shark snarfing Sam Jackson in the middle of a rousing speech.  What's going really great, Bob, is this offense. 5th-most runs scored in the MLB so far. Springer-Bichette-Vladdy-Chapman-Varsho at the top of the order have been lights out, and the added speed and smart baserunning behind them can erase any deficit at any time. Thankfully, we finally get our home opener today in the newly renovated Rogers Centre. Apologies for what we're about to do to the Tigers. That sets up a big early series against the steamrolling Rays of the Bay of Tampa. At least the first start of that one is being handed to (checks notes)... oh no... |**6-4**
**9**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+5**| It turns out that having a starting rotation of all #2s gets you [the best pitching staff](https://i.gyazo.com/fe5b95e1e99bc686a0e5b7df45d3a7de.jpg) in the majors. Who knew? The bats still need to wake up a bit, but overall it's looking like it will be a very good summer for Minnesota. |**6-3**
**10**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| Nice little 3-3 week from the Shit Goblins, as they took a series from the A's then won the season series against the M's.  At least one strong performance from each starter this week, and Myles Straw continues to impress. |**6-4**
**11**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-5**| **NO BLURB SUBMITTED** |**5-5**
**12**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+4**| This is an Andrew Wantz appreciation post. Why Andrew Wantz? Because he's about the only reliever for the team who has not provided the team with the anthesis of his job title. With 17 batters faced so far, he's allowed one hit and an unearned run with six strikeouts and no walks. Outside of him, the bullpen is posting a gaudy 5.27 ERA. Starting off 5-4 would have sounded fine had you told me on Opening Day, but man, there have been a few wins left on the table so far.  |**5-4**
**13**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-4**| Positives: Jordan Walker is hitting the hell out of some baseballs. Negatives: Pretty much everything else. But it's the first 9 games and I can't make a narrative at the beginning of April. The Cards are putting runners on, they just gotta score.  |**3-6**
**14**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| After the offensive explosion against the Phillies the offense has come crashing down back to earth and has gone missing some games. After an absolutely awful defensive showing in Chicago guys like Leody Taveras can't get healthier soon enough. Still ending the week over .500 which is neat. |**5-4**
**15**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-4**| Sloppy baseball, sloppy results. Feels like it's been the motto of the season so far. Teo and Kolten have yet to find their footing, but on the bright side, Kelenic has been off to a nice start - can he keep it going? The M's start a long stretch of 5 consecutive interleague series spanning until just about the end of the month, so it'll be an interesting change of pace but also what the heck, schedulers. Up next: 3 @ Chicago Baby Bears, 3 vs. Rocks (Feldspar) |**4-6**
**16**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-4**| The Phillies are 3-6 but ultimately had a decent week performance wise, losing 2/3 against the Yankees in the Bronx before flipping that result at home agianst the Reds. Factoring out the disastrous opening series, we're doing fine. Darick Hall, however, is not, so the Phillies have been forced to move Alec Bohm to first and start Edmundo Sosa to 3rd. For whatever reason, Cristian Pache has been set up to bat instead of being a late inning defensive/running replacement. Kyle Schwarber has been terrible besides a couple dingers, while Bryson Stott is looking like his potential peak self. Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola both bounced back in their second starts, while Kimbrel, Soto, and Dominguez have left a lot to be desired. The most impressive statline on the Phillies is Jose Alvarado, who has gotten 12 outs on 11 strikeouts while giving up just one hit. This week: three at home against the fish before heading to Cincinnati for the second 4 game series against the Reds on the season. |**3-6**
**17**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+3**| The D-backs took 3 of 4 from the Dodgers after splitting a two-game set in San Diego. Through 10 games, the D-backs stand 6-4 after a brutal early slate of games, all against NL juggernauts Dodgers and Padres. While it's too early to call this team contenders due to some glaring question marks in the rotation, the Snakes have delivered on taking full advantage of the team's strengths--athleticism, defense, and aggressiveness on the basepaths have yielded some exciting, winning baseball so far.  |**6-4**
**18**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+1**| DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERS. THE 2023 BOSTON RED SOX ARE THE GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME. Getting swept by the Pirates was a strategic move to lull other teams into a false sense of security. Starting with their sweep of the Tigers, the Sox have begun what will soon be the greatest winning streak in the history of ~~baseball~~ PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. Say goodbye to that perfect season Tampa... |**5-4**
**19**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Two weeks in and about where I thought the Orioles would be.  The next few series will be the telling tale.  They play their next 12 games against the A's, White Sox, Nationals and Tigers.  Nothing against those teams but if the O's don't go at least 8-4 then there might be more to worry about than we think.  Optioning Kyle Stowers this week was also very confusing because we now have 3 catchers on the active roster, which really doesn't make any sense.  I know the outfield is crowded but with all the other prospects we have at different positions are these younger guys just going to be blocked by people on the roster already? |**4-5**
**20**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+2**| The Cubs went 3-2 this week, splitting a 2 game series in Cincinnati then taking 2 out of 3 from the Rangers. They are a maddeningly inconsistent team in the early going, as the lineup and rotation are all or nothing. In the rotation, Marcus Stroman and Justin Steele have excelled but the other 3 starters have a combined ERA of 7.85. The schedule stiffens up significantly in the coming weeks, as 13 of their next 16 games are against the Dodgers, Mariners, and Padres.  |**4-4**
**21**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| The Giants lost a series to a good team, won a series vs a solid team, and lost a series against a bad team. Quick takeaways: Disco is crushing it, Manaea is good?,  theyre hitting and giving up homers, theyre playing close games, Hanniger, Slater, and Bart will join the team shortly, and theyve only had one significant injury, Perez, who is one of the Giants approximately 47 catchers. Lets look at the numbers: 13th in MLB in Run Diff, the Giants are in a healthy spot. 9th in RS / G, 19th in RA / G, 25th in Bullpen ERA  I think we can see where the early problem is. The pen will absolutely not be this bad so look for likely improvement, all around, on the pitching side. Up next is a series vs the Dodgers, one of only 2 at home all year because of Manfred, and absolutely neither fanbase has any clue what will happen. In this weeks Who and Why Are You? we take a closer look at new Giant [Sean Manaea](https://i.imgur.com/J8MAiPm.png). |**4-5**
**22**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-5**| After a somewhat hopeful 1st series against the Astros, the White Sox immediately imploded at home. Michael Kopech was apparently tipping his pitches and gave up 4 homers in an inning to the Giants. Eloy managed to get on the IL less than 1 week into the season. All fan bases need to remember to chant, ""It's still early,"" and Sox fans especially. The team has been hitting, but the pitching has been truly awful. Hopefully they can turn things around behind their hitting. |**4-6**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+3**| Oneil Cruz fractured his ankle, and the light has gone out of my life. |**6-3**
**24**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| The marlins still got a few questions marks at starter and in the BP but at least sandy and luzardo are still on point (seriously, Mel stottlemeyer is worth every penny of his contract). I def see some arms being called up from the minors sooner rather than later. on offense, there ain't as many questions marks but that's just cuz the lack of power was expected. When we hit the ball we usually hit it well, getting runs is a different story tho. Still waaaaay too many men LOB. Expect to see a decent amount of call-ups on defense and offense in the next month or so for the Fish. This week we got a series in Philly and we close the weekend out against the sneks at home. |**4-6**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**|  |**4-4**
**26**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-2**| First off, I'd like to thank kasutori_Jack for the opportunity to represent the Rockies. This week the Rockies got swept in a two game series on the road by the Dodgers and split a four game series at home to the Nationals, which isn't great, but about as good as I expected them to be.  I truly think the highlight of the year at the end of the season might be a rare 1-0 win during our home opener.  Big congratulations to CJ Cron on winning player of the week, though. |**4-6**
**27**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Is a 3-7 record ideal? Nope. However, the Royals are hitting the ball hard and the pitching has generally been solid. They just don't have anything to show for it. If the bats continue hitting the ball hard, those hits will come. And if the pitching is actually this solid, the Royals could be respectable. |**3-7**
**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| This week had me looking for the top 2024 MLB Draft options. I think it's going to be a long season. At least Akil Baddoo is back? Yeah, not too much to get overly excited about. I promise I won't be so negative all season long. This week: 3 at TOR, 3 vs. SFG. |**2-7**
**29**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| It's never too early to get hyped for some SSS output so that's what we're going to do. Let me tell you about 2023 All-Star Starting CF Victor Robles who is currently sporting a .924 OPS and is walking more than he's striking out - just stepping into the Bryce Harper and Juan Soto sized ""generational OF talent"" shoes. |**3-7**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**-1**| The A's have been outscored 39-24 this year and have looked immedaitely improved from last year's squad... if you ignore three blowouts where they were bested 35-1 and looked as bad as the franchise has been in decades. This year, injuries to two starters have exposed depth and the bullpen just regressed. Not to mention, Fujinami and his agent, Mr. Boras, absolutely insist that he's a starter (he is a reliever). But he can only pitch once a week! The defense is shakier than expected (worst in baseball so far) as the team decided to sacrifise what was a top-10 defense for slightly more hitting power. At least half of the dudes in the lineup will probably stick around for the electrifying upcoming September run, and Laureano is healthy so far. |**2-7**","baseball",68,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12hwr5v/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_2_tampa_bay/"

So how might these perceptions change if each World Series was reversed?

\*\*Warning: Seattle Mariners fans will not enjoy this post.\*\*

# AL East:

**Baltimore Orioles:** Overall, not much would change for the Orioles. The late 1960s and early 1970s would still be viewed as their golden age, going 2-2 in series from 1966-1971. They also would claim victory in the 1944 Streetcar Series over the ~~cross-town~~ cross-stadium rival St. Louis Cardinals. Unfortunately, Ripken would join the ranks of many other hall of fame players to never win a World Series despite all of his other accolades. 

**Boston Red Sox:** The Red Sox would be seen as much less successful (and probably less notable) than they are now. Instead of the Curse of the Bambino, the Red Sox would instead have 4 championships sandwiched between years of not being able to win the last game of the year. After failing to beat the representative from the National League numerous times in their early history, Ted Williams heroically returns from his service in WWII to lead the Red Sox to their first championship in 1946. David Ortiz also might not have been quite a sure-fire hall-of-famer without the three rings. 

**New York Yankees:** The ""Evil Empire"" Yankees would more likely be the ""First Order"" Yankees: an unbelievable amount of disappointment by comparison but still a level of success that most would take in a heartbeat. The Yankees would have lost a shocking 27 World Series, more than any other team has even played in. Maybe the most interesting historic change for the Yankees would be years of horrible disappointment from 1936 to 1962. During these Decades of Despair, the Yankees would be 4-16 in the World Series, with both a 4 and 5 year losing streak included. On the bright side, the 2001 Yankees would certainly be one of the greatest feel-good stories in the history of sports. 

**Tampa Bay Rays:** Truly the devil was holding the Rays back for their first 10 years, with the Rays winning their first World Series after dropping ""Devil"" from the name in 2008. The Rays perception would only increase, going from 0-2 to 2-0. Their coupon methods of searching scrap-heaps and polishing diamonds in the rough is unquestionably successful. With their second World Series win in 2020, the Rays would also be the youngest team to win more than one World Series, doing so at a pace of 12.5 seasons per championship. I'd also bet that the Rays catch a lot less flak than the Dodgers do for 2020's ""Mickey Mouse Championship."" 

**Toronto Blue Jays:** The Blue Jays fall victim to the unstoppable 1990s Braves in 1992 and lose the magic of Joe Carter's Series clinching homer in 1993. However, José Bautista's homer in 2015 would rise to another level with fans, being the team's first return to the postseason since back-to-back World Series losses and fueling hope for redemption. On a side note, reversing Toronto's World Series wins would make the *World* Series won only by US teams. 

# AL Central:

**Chicago White Sox:** Edit: sorry, forgot to copy/paste White Sox blurb. The White Sox would lose one championship in the net and be in the midst of a fairly long drought, going back to 1959. Their only other championship would ironically be the 1919 Series. Surely the mafia wouldn't be too happy with this though. On the bright side, Shoeless Joe would certainly be in the Hall of Fame now, but Nugenix spokesman Frank Thomas would lose his lone World Series Ring. Essentially, the White Sox would exist as ESPN still believes them to exist today.

**Cleveland Guardians:** Instead of having the longest active World Series drought, the Guardians would have four championships, with 3 coming in the last 30 years. Rajai Davis' homer in 2016's Game 7 would be seen as one of the most deflating moments in World Series history had Cleveland prevailed, especially since the series would have pitted a recently successful Indians team against the Cubs and their 71 year championship drought. Fortunately, this history would likely not prevent the making of *Major League* (and the worse but still enjoyable *Major League II*), as the Indians still had a significant pennant drought but would have followed the two movies up with two championships. 

**Detroit Tigers:** The Tigers would become one of the most successful franchises in league history, having the 6th most championships at 7. Their wins would include a tie for the longest World Series streak at 3, from 1907-1909. Miguel Cabrera's ring with the Marlins would be replaced by two with the Tigers, 2006 and 2012. The Detroit Tigers would also have had one of the longest championship droughts, not winning between their victories in 1940 and 2006. Early success would have buoyed their reputation, but the recent championships would revitalize their legacy.

**Kansas City Royals:** The Royals would have the 2nd smallest change to their history/perception if their World Series matchups were reversed. Championships in 1985 and 2015 would be exchanged for 1980 and 2014. George Brett would still have his championship ring, but Bret Saberhagen would lose his and Ben Zobrist's role would shift to that of a World Series jinx. 

**Minnesota Twins:** The Twins would lose their two most recent World Series wins, giving them a championship drought that goes back to 1965. Despite getting close in 1987 and 1991, they ultimately wouldn't beat the Cardinals in their run of success in the mid 1980s or the juggernaut 1990s Braves. The Twins franchise would also gain a World Series win as the Senators in 1933, though I doubt that's of little comfort to current fans. The lack of success in 1987 or 1991 would likely add to the sting of their recent postseason performances, making their situation feel even more hopeless. 

# AL West:

**Houston Astros:** In 2005, the Astros beat down the Chicago White Sox, shattering their hopes of ending their nearly 50 year World Series drought. 12 years later, trash cans can only help so much as they lose to the Dodgers in 2017. On the bright side, they likely would have a lot less hate than they do now and would be able to redeem themselves sooner with victories in 2019 and 2021. Might they have some Odd-Year-Bullshit? We'll see after 2023. 

**Los Angeles Angels:** The Angels would join a few other teams that have their only World Series appearance flip to a loss, in this case to the 2002 Giants and give Barry Bonds his only ring. The Rally Monkey would be just another forgotten gimmick, like this year's rally shoe. There's a joke in here somewhere about the Angels still not being good enough to win a World Series with Trout and Ohtani in this alternate history, but I'm too sad to make it. 

**Oakland A's:** The A's would no longer have the most World Series championships in the city of Philadelphia, though they would be tied with the Phillies at 2 World Series wins by the time of their departure in 1955. The A's dynasty in the early 1970s would reverse, despite incredible performances by Reggie Jackson and 80-grade name players Vida Blue and Catfish Hunter. The 1988 World Series might also be most remembered for Mark McGwire's walk-off homer in Game 3 that began a comeback to counter Kirk Gibson's Game 2 heroics. 

**Seattle Mariners:** I warned you that Mariners fans wouldn't enjoy this post. 

**Texas Rangers:** David Freese who? Perhaps Josh Hamilton would've cemented his place as a Rangers legend had the 2 run lead from his 10th inning homer in Game 6 held. Maybe another hero would've risen in Game 7. Either way, the Rangers would be viewed similarly to the Blue Jays currently are: winning back-to-back World Series appearances and remaining undefeated. 

# NL East:

**Atlanta Braves:** The 1990s Braves would be viewed as one of the greatest dynasties in baseball history, with 4 World Series wins in a 9 year stretch (8 championship seasons). Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz add to their hardware while certainly providing heartbreak to the Twins, Blue Jays, and Yankees along the way. Sadly for the Braves, 2021 would possibly be remembered as a ""What If"" year; maybe if Acuña had been healthy or a few trades had gone differently, they could've gotten their parade. Interestingly, if each World Series matchup was reversed, the Braves would still have championships in Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta. 

**Miami Marlins:** The Marlins would never have won a World Series, but is that so surprising? They've never even won their division! And it's pretty unthinkable for a team to make the postseason twice as a Wild Card and emerge victorious both times. Like the Blue Jays, the Marlins would still be in search of their first World Series trophy. Still, reaching the World Series twice in their 30 years is respectably average for being in a 15-team league. 

**New York Mets:** After their inability to overcome the Orioles in 1969, the Mets were able to capture their first championship a few years later in 1973. Unfortunately, the '86 Mets also fall short against the Red Sox, maybe due to an issue with their coke supplier. Recent years would be more friendly to the Mets, being able to beat the Yankees in 2000 and the Royals in 2015, giving championship rings to David Wright, Bartolo Colón, and Jacob deGrom. 

**Philadelphia Phillies:** The beer would still be flowing in the streets of Philadelphia and the light poles would still smell of Crisco with the Phillies coming off their most recent championship over the Houston Astros. Despite their poor performances in the regular season, the Phillies would be viewed as one of the more successful franchises in baseball, with 6 World Series wins. Maybe they'd have some sort of magic for capitalizing on the times when they have great teams, despite the numerous disappointing seasons in between. 

**Washington Nationals:** Without a victory in 2019, the Nationals might be viewed as one of the biggest ""what-if"" teams in the league, especially from 2010-2019. They might be viewed similarly to the Colorado Rockies are now. Despite being a star-mill pumping out players like Bryce Harper, Juan Soto, Stephen Strasburg, and Trea Turner, the Nationals still couldn't win the final game of the year. Also in both realities, the Nationals don't get to give out rings or raise the flag in 2020. 

# NL Central:

**Chicago Cubs:** From lovable losers to one of the greatest franchises in the Pre-Integration Era. The Cubs jump out early to defeat the White Sox in 1906 and follow it with 7 steady championships over the next 40 years. By the time of their final championship in 1945 (I guess they still pick up the Curse of the Goat), the Cubs 8 World Series wins would actually be the most in the league, though they would slowly be overcome by the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants in the years to come. As mentioned with the Guardians, the Rajai Davis homer in 2016 would likely be viewed as the most heartbreaking moment in Cubs history. 

**Cincinnati Reds:** The Reds history remains relatively similar if their World Series' were reversed. They would still have a win in the late 1930s/early 1940s and the Big Red machine would still have 2 World Series titles. The most impactful change would be the reversal of the 1919 World Series. Without the Black Sox scandal, the history of Major League Baseball would likely be vastly different, as the scandal led to the creation of the office of the commissioner of Major League Baseball. Still, imagine the embarrassment if the White Sox bet against themselves in the World Series, but the Reds found a way to lose on their own.  

**Milwaukee Brewers:** The Brewers (then a member of the American League) would gain a victory in the 1982 World Series (the ""Suds Series"" against the St. Louis Cardinals). This would be their lone championship, making them similar to how we currently view teams like the Diamondbacks and Angels. Also, both Robin Yount and Paul Molitor would get World Series rings with the Brewers (replacing Molitor's 1993 ring with Toronto). 

**Pittsburgh Pirates:** Despite winning the first World Series against the Boston Americans, the Pirates history becomes one of heartbreak. The Pirates would have the longest active World Series drought, not having won since conquering Murderer's Row in 1927. To make things even worse, the Pirates would lose championships featuring true legends like Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell in the 1960s and 1970s. The real winner of this scenario is Bobby Richardson, who would likely still win WS MVP in 1960 (the only one awarded to a player on the losing team). 

**St. Louis Cardinals:** The Cardinals lose a few championships (going from 11 to 8), but still enjoy success in similar eras. The Gashouse Gang of the 1920s and early 1930s, Stan Musial leading the team to victory in 1943, the success of Whiteyball in the 1980s, and two championships in the career of Yadier Molina. If each World Series were reversed, the Cardinals/Cubs rivalry would likely have risen to another level. After the Cubs stormed out to 8 championships by 1945, the rival Cardinals slowly chipped away, catching up to the Cubs with a victory over the Red Sox in 2013.

# NL West:

**Arizona Diamondbacks:** The Diamondbacks lose their sole World Series victory, but would still have their role in the feel-good 2001 Yankees. Not much else notable would change though. Randy Johnson would now have more bHBP (birds hit-by-pitch) than World Series victories and the Diamondbacks would join the Nationals and Angels as teams to have only reached the World Series once and walked away empty-handed. 

**Colorado Rockies:** Instead of a demoralizing sweep at the hands of the Red Sox, the Rockies would possibly have been able to turn the tables and finish the postseason undefeated in 2007. Unfortunately, this would not change much for the current Rockies, unless Monfort became addicted to winning and put more into the team after 2007. 

**Los Angeles Dodgers:** The Los Angeles Dodgers are the New York Yankees of baseball (in this scenario too). Their 14 World Series wins would be the most in the league, narrowly ahead of the Yankees. Half of their championships would have come at the hands of the New York Yankees, defeating them in three times in the '40s, twice in the '50s, and twice in the '70s. 2017 would likely also have extra significance after the Astros scandal came out, as one of the times that the ""good guys"" were able to win. The biggest downside to this reality for the Dodgers is that Sandy Koufax loses two of his World Series rings and only pitches in 1 (1966). 

**San Diego Padres:** With wins in 1984 and 1998, the Padres would become one of the more successful expansion teams, being undefeated in their two series appearances. This would be similar to the Blue Jays currently and the Padres championship total would match the Pirates, White Sox, Royals, Rangers, and Rays. Tony Gwynn would gain two World Series rings and possibly winning MVP in 1998 if he performed similar to reality (8-16 with a homerun). 

**San Francisco Giants:** The Giants, like the Detroit Tigers, would have the longest championship streak at 3 years. The biggest change in their history would be in their early years, gaining 4 championships from 1911-1937. Dusty Baker's first championship as a manager would have come 20 years sooner with the San Francisco Giants. Like the Dodgers, the Giants also take a number of championships away from the New York Yankees (3 in their case). Although maybe the even-year-bullshit would be viewed more as a curse in this reality.

**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Everyone's favorite [myliobatiformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myliobatiformes) played another good week of baseball with the return of Tyler Glasnow. The Rays took an exciting series against the Dodgers after recharging during a weird mid-series rest day against the Blue Jays. Wander Franco is making his case to be starting SS in the All-Star Game, just make sure you don't accidentally vote for one of his brothers. It's still super weird to watch the offense carry while the bullpen struggles, but with guys coming back it should be f--, wait, Fairbanks is hurt again. |**39-17**
**2**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| Series wins against both the Pirates and Orioles the last week has the club holding the 3rd best overall record in the majors. Go Stars. We're still having fun. |**34-19**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-1**| 3-4 last week and we started this week off with a loss against the Oakland ""Triple A's"" which is not good Bob. On the VERY brightside, we saw Soroka pitch from an MLB mound for the first time in almost 3 years. He pitched well and we need him to perform as we are absolutely depleted by injuries. Riley is starting to come to life. We hold a 4 game lead on the scond place MARLINS. Our division doesn't want to take advantage of our recent struggles, that's fine by me. |**32-22**
**4**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**|  |**33-22**
**5**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| A few weeks ago, I said if the Orioles can go at least .500 in May then they are for real. They wrapped up a winning month yesterday and have three games to go. They continue to play well, even though they lost the series against the Rangers, and seem to play better away from Camden Yards. They did, however, send Grayson Rodriguez down this week to AAA. He just has some stuff to figure out. He was getting crushed in his past few starts, and it was the right move to make. This solidifies the fact they need a frontline starter if they are going to make a serious push to get to and make noise in the post-season. |**34-20**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| Jose Abreu finally hit a home run. All is right with the world. Unless the world's name is Lance McCullers Jr., who had another discomforting setback and we have no idea when we will see him this year. I still blame his hair. Anyway, our other Jose hit a grand slam at MMP this weekend. Where have we heard that before? |**31-22**
**7**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**0**| It certainly wouldve been nice to take 2/3 from Baltimore, but its very hard to be mad at the Yankees month of May. Since May 1, the Yankees are 18-9, a huge turnaround from a .500 April. As we enter the dog days of summer, the top of the AL East is tightening up, but the Yankees dont face either of the teams ahead of them again until July. The Yankees have to keep playing at this pace, and a Stanton (and maybe Rodon??) return could seriously help that.  |**33-23**
**8**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had a decent week, barely missing out on a sweep of the Phillies before dropping a series to the Red Sox. The offense gets on base but has been allergic to driving in RISP, and the starting rotation continues to be a merry-go-round, as none of the rookie pitchers on the team seem to be able to string together several good starts in a row without getting blown up once or twice.  |**31-23**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+1**| The Jays' first series win since May 14th pulled us out of a bad-vibes tailspin the likes of which this fanbase hasn't seen since, well, the last time everybody freaked out over a losing streak. The usual suspects' continued confounding slow starts (Manoah, Kirk, Varsho, etc) have dropped us 10 games back from TB, last place in the best division in baseball. And YET, hope springs. Berrios (3 or fewer ER in 8 of his last 9 starts) finally appears to be pitching to the level expected of him when he was signed, and is pumping out quality starts along with Gausman and Bassitt. Kikuchi has slipped as Kikuchi does but has been very solid for a #5. We don't have the depth to send Manoah down for some needed alone time, but he's pushing it. Vladdy has been scuffling, Springer is heating up, and Bichette is an MVP candidate. With a little bit of lucky regression to the mean with abysmal RISP numbers, this team is just a few turns away from being very good. As long as we don't have to play too many games vs AL East teams. That should be fine.  |**28-26**

**11**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+4**| Just what the doctor ordered - 6-1 in the homestand so far. Some momentum is just what this team needs before two big series with teams they're chasing for playoff spots. If the M's can handle business over the next week, they'll be right back in the thick of it. Bryce Miller, do your thing. Up next: 3 vs. Damn Yankees, 3 @ Globe Life ~~Park~~~~Field~~~~Stadium~~~~Gardens~~~~Arena~~~~Dome~~whatever they're calling it these days |**28-26**
**12**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-1**| Scoring four runs total while getting swept by the Angels isn't a great look. This team is in many ways aggresively mediocre, always making sure that every win streak is followed up by an equally painful gut-punch. This is mainly due to the reliance on the offense to carry us to victory (2-17 when scoring &lt;=3 runs), when the bats get cold, you're safe to turn off the game. Whitlock returning from injury and Bello/Sale both stepping up their game in May (2.74/2.42 ERA respectively) are good steps towards this team becoming Actually Good"" though. We'll see what June brings us...  |**28-25**
**13**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| Taking two of three from the Astros was nice.  Barely avoiding a sweep from the Giants was not so sweet.  Milwaukee has some issues with hitting in ""close"" situations.  The Brewers either lose after having multiple opportunities to tie it up, or get absolutely blown out.  |**28-25**
**14**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| Did I travel out of state and all the way to Anaheim just to watch the team get swept by the Marlins? Perhaps. Was that objectively worse than what the Reds voter is going through? It's impossible to say.  |**29-26**
**15**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-2**| The Mets, who I proclaimed to be ""good at baseball"" last week, ended up dropping 2 of 3 against the Cubs and doing the same against the Rockies. I just don't know what to believe anymore. The only thing I know for sure is that Francisco Alvarez has got that fucking dawg in him, he's GOATed, he's him, he's on fleek, he's poggers, he's a proper legend, he's got an .885 OPS, he's a top bloke, he's got swag, he's fresh, he's Gen Z Mike Piazza, he's lit, he's making me feel old because he was born after 9/11, he's Francisco Alvarez. |**27-27**
**16**|[](/SFG)|**Gigantes**|**+4**| The Giants won yesterday, but strictly talking about last week, they went 5- 2 on an extremely acceptable road trip without any off days. Defeating two competent teams like the Twins and Brewers should feel good. On both losses, they gave up 7 runs, on every win they gave up 3, 1, or 0 runs. So, they threw two games out of 7  thats allowed. In the bad news department, Joc, Joey, and Thairo all not expected back until June 6th. I think were okay with more Bailey Patrick and this also means another look at unpredictable slugger David Villar. Slater continues covering for Joc. Lets look a the numbers: 13th in MLB in Run Diff (+6 spots), 12th in RS / G (+6), 15th in RA / G (+2), 23rd in Bullpen ERA (+5). All of that is good and especially the bullpen is promising recently. The Giants continue at home vs the Pirates  and wrap the homestand with 3 against our orange and black brothers in Baltimore. |**28-26**
**17**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-1**| Would I have been happy to learn on Opening Day that the Pirates would be around .500 at the end of May? Yes. But if you told me they got there after starting 20-8 I would be pretty disappointed. Here's hoping the pendulum swings the other way in June. |**26-27**
**18**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+3**|Yet another appearance of sweepy, the meme that was promised. After a rough series against the rox, we sweep the angels to settle into the third NL wild card spot. Our starting pitching is coming along after a bumpy start to several of our starters. Eury perez is gonna be a stud, just wanna remind yall. Also, shout out to Jorge Soler, who has been crushing baseballs the last week and change. In other miami sports related news, boston is the first city ever to lose two game 7s at home in both the NHL and NBA playoffs in the same year. Go Heat and go Panthers!|**28-26**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| After losing 2 to the Diamondbacks and going down 5-0 in the 3rd game, the Phillies season looked as bleak as it could in late May while only being 4 games under .500. However, the team rallied and Trea Turner tied it in the 9th before going onto win it in 10. Then, they went down to Atlanta and split a 4 game series. It could've gone far worse. The Phillies most pressing need is now seemingly a 5th starter who isn't a guaranteed loss, as this week they trotted out Dylan Covey, who hadn't started a game since 2019. He got 2 outs and gave up 7 runs. He took the spot of Bailey Falter who, after a surprisingly productive 2022, started the season 0-7. Falter is the far better option, but Dave Dombrowski will likely be looking to upgrade until Andrew Painter can finally return. This week, the NL East road trip continues with their first 3 games against the Mets and 3 in Washington. Here's hoping June Schwarber shows up again this year. |**25-28**
**20**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| My Dad tells me its ok that the Dads lost 2 / 3 to NY; the Dodgers lost 2 / 3 to the Rays! The Pads arent in the same stratosphere as the Dodgers right now, though. 5 games under .500, 10th in the NL standings, 3 games out of the last wildcard slot. Of course theres quite a bit of time to change it, theres plenty of time to go on a run, or a slow and steady good month to gain ground. With every day that passes however, that goal becomes a bit harder to reach; I dont think Pads fans were hoping for a wildcard spot by the end of this season, but thats the position the team has to get to before even thinking of catching LA. The Padres are 4th in the NL West, and only a half game out of last. |**24-29**
**21**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-3**| 2-2 @ CIN; 1-2 @ CLE; 0-1 v KCR; another struggle week for the Cards. The fandom's been a bit kneejerk because of two good weeks before this. Their mistake. I'll say it a third time, the Cards playing at or beyond their expected level doesn't change the rotten FO. Yeah Marmol's pretty close to being fired, that's not a fix when the problem is John Mozeliak. |**24-32**
**22**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+2**| The most fun part of this past week has been watching the resurgence of Akil Baddoo. His energy is infectious and adds an exciting dimension to the lineup. As we head into the last few days of May, Baddoo has sported a .302/.405/.508 slash and a 155 wRC+ this month. Although he's still been hitting mostly in the 6 hole, if this keeps up he might find himself much higher in the order real soon. This week: 2 more vs. TEX and 3 at CWS. |**25-27**
**23**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians won a series this week. I would like to see them win some games by more than one run, but it's clear this season, we have to take what we get. |**24-29**
**24**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**| Another terrible week for the Cubs, as a promising series win against the Mets was followed up by an embarrassing sweep against the Reds. The starting rotation was terrible, and the bullpen was somehow worse. Fans have had enough of David Ross, and Jed Hoyer is starting to come under pressure. Barring a dramatic turnaround, the Cubs will be sellers for the 3rd trade deadline in a row |**23-30**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+1**| Okay guys, Im here to be calm this week. I have been told by my wifes attorney, Tom, that they are aware of my online activity regarding our impending divorce, so today lets have a nice, calm, relaxing, perfectly fine, good old fashioned talk about Reds baseball. The Reds are just sorta middling. Theyre not great but theyre not horrible. Unlike my marriage. Our starting pitching has resgressed, just like my marriage, and its very unfortunate to see, because our bullpen has been quite reliable unlike my wife. We still cant hit home runs for some reason, but overall unlike my marriage the Reds on the upturn. There, are you happy Tom? I didnt mention all the crap thats been going on lately. I didnt mention how I had to leave the Motel 6 I was at because I found a used needle in the bathroom, and by the way Tom, I know that youre trying to use that as evidence that I cant take care of my kids. I dont even know whos needle it was, it was like wedged behind the toilet. Believe me, I only found it because I dropped my phone while using the toilet. It wasnt even visible, I had to like get on my hands and knees and crawl behind the toilet to grab my phone. So it puts the image in my head of some heroin addict or whatever sitting behind a toilet at a Motel 6 trying to get high, which honestly that just seems like an even worse situation than the one im in. Do I think its a coincidence that the day after I left the Motel 6 because of this, youre requesting a drug test from me before I can see my kids? Huh Tom? How did you know about this incident Tom? The only people that know are the Motel 6 staff I notified, I dont think any police showed up, so either you questioned them like im some criminal, or youre following me. I know youre reading this Tom, youve made several references to my posts on the baseball power rankings insinuating its me writing them, and yeah Tom youre right it is me, can everybody in the comments give praise to Tom for being a regular Sherlock Holmes? Yeah everybody come on, Congratulations Tom! Youre the man! Im gonna let you go home and fuck my sister, oh wait Tom I forgot, YOU ALREADY ARE. When you get home tonight tell Caitlin her brother says hi. Alright, I think I got that out of my system. Anyway, I think once more of our prospects are called up, probably around June or July, we may get hot and finish more closely to .500 than initially thought, and if this division stays like it is, and those prospects can deliver on their promise, it's entirely possible we could be in contention for the division. But a lot of this is gonna depend on if our Starting Rotation can get things back under control. Also we swept the Cubs so lol. |**24-29**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Week after week, I expect this Nats team to take a nose dive. I expect them to crumble and slip into a double-digit losing streak but it just isn't happening. They lead the NL in batting average (.267), are third in OBP (.330) and have the lowest strikeout rate in MLB. They still have their own troubles, but this team is alive (4 games out of a WC spot) |**23-31**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**+1**| I don't have time to write a real blurb this week so you don't have to print this.  Actually, you probably don't read these, I'm not sure anyone really reads them anyways besides the Reds guy's life breaking down, and this will probably get printed regardless. |**24-31**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-1**| Liam is back. I can't overstate how great that is to hear. He is one of the best people in the game and it's nothing short of amazing for him to be pitching in May. If you missed it, it was recently revealed that he had stage 4 lymphoma, not an early stage. He started treatment just over 3 months ago! Nothing on the field matters for this team, but at least there's that silver lining. |**22-34**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| As of the time that this blurb is being written (Monday at 11:39 AM), only two teams in the majors have a record below .400. Yup, the Royals are there with the A's. I suppose the positive is that the team figured out that they can get rid of useless players in Hunter Dozier, but they still have a lot more work to do. |**17-38**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Atléticos**|**0**| The A's have given up 10+ runs in a game 7 more times than they've won. It's a mix of bad roster building (the bullpen), under-preforming vets (Ramon Laureano 74 wRC+, Tony Kemp 38 wRC+), injuries (Seth Brown and Paul Blackburn are just now returning), and no fans in the stands since 2019. It's soul crushing to watch and the national media's constant condecention toward this particular poor team and it is even more annoying this year. |**11-45**","baseball",60,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13w2ovi/2023_rbasbeall_power_rankings_week_9_tuesday/"

"2023-01-16",1673879685,"the Twins are the only team to never get no-hit at home ...sort of.","Out of the thirty current MLB teams, all of them have had a no-hitter thrown against them at home, except for the Minnesota Twins. Even including their years as the Washington Senators, they have never been held hitless in their own stadium. Every single other team has suffered this ignominy.

...except, not really. There's two others. Kind of.

The Washington Nationals have never been no-hit in DC. In fact, they've never had a no-hitter thrown against them, period... since they changed identities. The problem is, they were no-hit four times as the Expos, including once in Montréal, by Tommy Greene of the Phillies in 1991.  

OK, but that's still the same franchise, so it's settled - the Expos/Nationals have been no-hit at home. True... but it may be worth noting that no Washington MLB franchise - the Nationals or either iteration of the Senators - has ever been no-hit in their own stadium. In other words, in 89 seasons of Washington baseball, no home crowd has watched their team go hitless. That seems significant.

As for the other team? The Houston Astros have been no-hit once when they were the home team, by Carlos Zambrano of the Cubs in 2008. The only caveat is that the teams weren't in Texas - they were in Wisconsin, playing a neutral site game forced by Hurricane Ike. Of course, seeing as this ""neutral site"" was Milwaukee and the opponent was the Chicago Cubs, more than a few fans of the ""visitors"" made the trek up I-94 to see their team, resulting in a game that didn't feel quite so neutral after all. So the Astros have been no-hit as the home team, but never in their home stadium.

Also, let's give a quick shout-out to the St. Louis Cardinals, who were last no-hit at home in 1906 when Mal Eason of the Brooklyn Superbas threw a no-hitter at St. Louis's League Park, better known as Robison Field. The 117 seasons without being no-hit at home is the longest streak in the majors.","baseball",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10dg1qt/the_twins_are_the_only_team_to_never_get_nohit_at/"

I live 5 hours away, so Im not able to make it to many games in person. I tracked from Opening Day, which I was thankfully able to attend. Last night I sadly went 0-fer and my streak came to an end.

Just insane durability for a guy who was consistently elite during this time. Even notable Ironmen like Nolan Ryan can't even come close to this streak (Nolan maxed out at 5 straight 200IP seasons). *EDIT: I did check out Bert Blyleven on a whim and he did have a streak of 10 seasons over 200IP.*

During the 14-year streak Maddux:

- Pitched 3364.1 innings (over 240 IP per season)
- Had an ERA of 2.69 (153 ERA+) and a WHIP of 1.087, and a FIP of 2.93.
- Won 4 Cy Youngs, a World Series, 12 Gold Gloves, and made 8 All-Star appearances.
- Pitched 186 post-season innings, which is 13.2 innings per year.
- Threw exactly 100 complete games, with 33 shutouts.

In my mind the 90's and 2000's was an absolute golden age for all-time great pitchers. Not pitchers overall, but a select few all-timers. I absolutely love how different they all were too. Pedro, Randy Johnson, Clemens**, and Maddux were all wildly different, but all absolutely incredible, and I love dissecting their careers to find amazing tidbits like this.","baseball",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/z8dcur/greg_maddux_pitched_over_200_innings_in_every/"

This results in ambiguity for some players' season and career hits totals, notably with Cap Anson. Anson was credited with a .421 average and the National League batting title in 1887; however, the recalculation of averages with walks excluded lowered his average to .347 and retroactively gave the batting title to Sam Thompson. Additionally Denny Lyons of the Philadelphia Athletics had a 52-game hitting streak, the second-longest in MLB history behind Joe DiMaggio's 56-game streak in 1941.

#Introduction for new and renewed interest fans.

Baseball has a long season. I don't just mean that in terms of time between opening day and the World Series (which can be considered long as it is), but also the 162 games played in 183 days, 13 times against the same 4 teams each. It can be daunting, and many people lose interest by ""the dog days"" of June and July. 

This guide is meant to help you if you wish to avoid being one of those who feels overwhelmed and loses interest a couple weeks after Opening Day.

First and foremost if you are a new fan or newly returning, you must remember one thing: you do not need to watch every game. Many football fans, and even some basketball and hockey fans, find this difficult, they're used to setting aside a few nights a week to watch their team, and they can watch all the games. Baseball isn't like that. For the next six months, your team will only have 23 days where they won't be playing a game. And some of the games they play will start as early as 9:20am (Pacific Time), others will end after 1am (Eastern Time). If you miss a game it's okay, odds are there's another one tomorrow. If you miss a week, no big deal, hell if you get busy for a few months and aren't able to watch you team, that's not an issue, because you can still *follow* your team.

Baseball is a game to be followed. In the old days it meant picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores. Now it means being able to have a final score texted/tweeted/messaged/emailed/what-evered to you the minute the game ends, or rolling over in bed when you can't sleep and grabbing your phone to check the West Coast scores. It means being able to check reddit in the morning to see any breaking news from across the league, or catch a story you missed. We live in a time where you can go to MLB.com and get a recap of every game from last night in less than 10 minutes. Honestly, baseball was made to be consumed, and the technology age makes it easier than ever, whether you want to spend hours every day pouring over stats and analysis, or 15 seconds to see how your team and their playoff rivals did today.

The rest of this guide is mostly dedicated to ways that you can help yourself follow your team, and if you have time follow the entirety of MLB.

#World Baseball Classic

If you are new to the sport, you may not have even known that there is a worldwide competition (ostensibly) every four years that pit country against country to crown a World Champion. Part of that is the fact that we haven't had one since 2017 as the covid pandemic disrupted the qualification process for the 2021 edition scheduled to take place in 2020, and global travel restrictions prevented rescheduling until this year. But IT CAME BACK! And we won't have to wait four yours for the next edition as they plan on the next classic to be held in 2026, on opposite even years from the Olympics in case baseball is re-added as a sport so there won't be any overlap in qualification and competition cycles between the two events.

This years format involved 20 teams split into 4 groups. Each group played a round robin group stage, with the top two teams from each group advancing to an eight team single elimination tournament. Mexico, USA, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Japan, Italy, Cuba, and Australia advanced to the knock out stage which culminated in an absolutely dream matchup of USA-Japan in the final with the final at bat of the game coming down to Shohei Ohtani pitching to Mike Trout - if they had scripted it in a movie no one would have believed it.

If you missed this year's edition definitely set time aside in March 2026 to watch the next one - the atmospheres at most of the games are absolutely amazing as Latin American and Asian teams have fans that go all out and it truly feels like playoff baseball in the spring.

For more information on results you can [check out the World Baseball Classic website](https://www.mlb.com/world-baseball-classic/schedule/2023-03-07) or, just as helpful, [the 2023 tournament wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Baseball_Classic)

#Rule Changes for MLB 2023

The following changes will not be in place for the World Baseball Classic but will for MLB.

Updates from 2022 One Year Changes

 - REMOVED: Rosters will be expanded from 26 to 28 players in April with no limit on pitchers due to shortened spring training.
 - MADE PERMANANT: In extra innings the person in the batting order immediately before the lead off hitter will start on second base. This rule does not apply in the postseason.

Permanent Changes for 2023:

 - Pitch clock of 15 seconds with bases empty, 20 seconds with runners on, beginning when the pitcher receives the ball. Pitchers failing to begin their motion when the pitch clock expires will be penalized with an automatic ball.
 - Batters must be in the box ready with at least 8 seconds remaining. Penalty: Automatic Strike
 - Batters allowed one time out per plate appearance.
 - Pitchers may call pitches using pitch com.
 - Pitchers are allowed two free pick offs attempts or step offs per plate appearance. On subsequent pick off attempts either an out must be made, or the runners advance one base for free. If runners advance, the free pick off/step offs reset.
 - Ban on certain shifts: teams must have two players on the left and right sides of second base on the infield, all four must have feet on infield dirt.
 - Bases have been enlarged from 15 inches on each side to 18 inches on each side.
 - Position players are only allowed to pitch when:
  - Their team is down by 8+ runs
  - Their team is up by 10 runs in the 9th
  - Anytime in extra innings

Potential future changes being testes in the minors:

 - Automatic ball/strike calling.
  - Fully automated strike zone 
  - Umps calling strikes, but teams having 3 challenges to a ball/strike call.

Rule Emphasis

 - Balks for pitchers who do not come fully set before delivering a pitch will be called more often.

#Finding a Team

I always recommend following the local team since you'll have more access to news about them in the local media and should be able to get their radio broadcast, as well as TV broadcasts of them if you have cable/satellite/streaming, and depending on where you're at the occasional over the air game, but if you don't live by a team or don't want to follow the local team, or are just looking for a second team to follow, [I wrote this in depth guide to picking a team that's the right fit for you.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/11coiba/looking_for_a_team_to_follow_in_2023_help_is/)

#Knowing Where Different Teams Stand

Every year ESPN, Sports Illustrated, FOX, NBC, and every other sports related site puts out their season previews. These are great for getting a basic rundown of what is going on with each team, and a simple google search will bring up a plethora of possible articles to read.

For a succinct snapshot of team expectations, [you can look at the fangraphs projected standings](https://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Standings) and [projected playoff odds](https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds) or for a slightly different model you can check the [PECOTA projected standings and playoff odds.](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/) While these aren't as in depth as team previews, looking at both can show which teams are consensus favorites, and which ones are more wild cards in how they're expected to perform.

If what you really want is a fans perspective on what each team's expectations condensed into a few short comments, I'd highly recommend going through each teams day from our annual ""Why will X team exceed expectations?"" series which is currently running every weekday and stickied.

#R/Baseball

Alright, so plugging r/baseball on r/baseball seems a bit redundant, but I think it's a good reminder that this is a great hub for all your MLB news throughout the season while still letting you see the occasional amazing college/minor league/foreign league performance.

During the season there are a number of features to keep you informed of all the goings on around baseball. 

Every day of the season (and a portion of the offseason) there are General Discussion threads called Around the Horn. These are great places to ask questions and discuss anything that you want to know about baseball but don't feel like it deserves it's own post. In the Around the Horn post you'll be able to see a full schedule of what is going on around R/Baseball every week.

During the week the subreddit runs a number of features. **Please note that the mods are still unsure of exactly what features they will be running this year.*:

**Daily: Nightly Pick'Em** - A nine year running contest to pick the result of one game every day. [Here's last year's introduction thread where you can find details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/mh9ffe/nightly_pick_em_rbaseball_edition_season_seven_a/)

**Monday: Power Rankings** - A team of 30 fans from every team in baseball, led by ~~masochist~~ fearless leader /u/kasutori_jack, releases their composite power rankings of the 30 teams. This leads to well thought out discussions and some in depth analysis, as well as salty fans crying about how their team is underrated (there may be more of the latter than the former, but it's still a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of how every team is doing). 

**Monday: State of the Subreddits** -  /u/double_dose_larry took over posting a State of the Subreddits post that gives the top post from each team's subreddit from the last week. This is a great roundup post for staying up to date on what all the different team fandoms are feeling, and helps you catch any milestones you might have otherwise missed.

**Tuesday: Weekly Awards** - Led by /u/lemcoe9 a different team of a fan from every team releases the results of their weekly (and monthly) voting for who the best position player and pitcher was since the last vote was taken. Once again, a great way to keep track of which players are on hot streaks, and who's dominating the league.

**Wednesday: Wild Card Wednesday** - Each week a new contest, trivia game, or just out of the box fun thread will be stickied! Got an idea? Let the mods know!

**Thursdays: Division Discussions** - Rotating between the Easts, Centrals, and Wests to do some more in depth talk about where the playoff races and teams stand. If you only have time for one r/baseball thread every week and want to keep up with the league, this is the thread to set aside time for. 
 
**Friday: Trash Talk/Compliment/Complaint** - FRIDAYS ARE FUN DAYS, ROTATING BETWEEN TRASH TALK, COMPLIMENT, TRASH TALK, AND COMPLAINT THREADS! TRADITION STATES ALL COMMENTS BE IN ALL CAPS AND ENDING IN EXCLAMATION POINTS! ROTATION IS USED RATHER THAN HAVE A SET DAY FOR EACH ALL SEASON BECAUSE IT'S A LONG SEASON AND ANY ONE OF THE THREE THREADS CAN GET STALE FAST IF YOU DON'T LEAVE TIME FOR MORE AMMUNITION! 

**Saturday**: Saturday is when the mods usually plug in occasional things that don't necessarily deserve weekly attention. Things like in depth stat discussions, memorabilia sharing, craft projects, etc.

**Sunday: Game of the Week** - Sunday is the one day a week where we get together as a subreddit to watch a baseball game together, since it's the one time every week where there's only one game going on and there's guaranteed to be a game. The Sunday Night Baseball game thread is usually posted a couple hours before the first pitch.

In addition the playoffs, and select premier match-ups (mostly at the very end of the season where there is a lot riding on a regular season game, as well as opening day) there are game threads for all r/baseball users. These are neutral thread, for more info on less neutral ones skip to the next section. This has gone back and forth the last few years with people asking for more game threads, then many of said game threads being empty because everyone is in their own team's sub discussing the game. If you have ideas for what sort of games deserve r/baseball game threads, leave them in the comments.

In addition to all these features, it really is a great place to keep up with breaking news and highlights. It'll be posted here minutes after someone tweets it, and long before it's on MLB.com. Team beat writers get the stories first, and it's easier to check in here a couple times a day than follow every one of them.

**Another note - for the best R/Baseball experience, you should use Old Reddit, which you can access by visiting old.reddit.com/r/baseball.** Old reddit includes a fun sidebar with a full scoreboard of the day's action as well as the current league standings (with little flags that tell you who's in wild card position).

---

#Your Team's Subreddit (And other team subs as well)

The mods at r/baseball have one goal - help you have the best possible reddit baseball experience, and a LOT of that is helping you get connected to other fans of your team (which feels a little like a cop-out because it means less work for us if you're doing more on your team's sub, but your team's mods aren't complaining.)

One of the main draws of team subs (other than in depth discussion with like-fan-minded users, getting breaking news and analysis on your team, team-memes, and other reddit discussions that come up from a group of individuals who can agree on one thing) are game threads. At this time (to the best of my knowledge) every team sub hosts game threads for their team's games, and you can easily access them in the sidebar during the season by clicking on the team's logo in the schedule. We like to keep the game threads in team subs for a few reasons, one of which is we want to support the team subs and send them relevant traffic when we can because they really do an amazing job, another is because with 15 games a day this place would look like crap if we had game threads for every game or let users post them as they please (we've tried it, it blots out news, discussion, and highlights and looks like crap, baseball doesn't have only a couple days set aside for games or focus on marquee match ups like many other sports, it's 2430 games played in 183 days and is better when it's spread out.)

Even if you're not a game thread person though, getting connected with a good team sub can make disappointing seasons more bearable, and great seasons more exciting, and I know plenty of users that said that their team's sub basically keeps them fans. Team subs are also a great place to get connected to...

#Twitter, Podcasts, and YouTube Channels

The best way to find the people to follow/sites to visit that interest you the most are to hang around your team's sub and note which Tweets/Sites that are linked to that most often peak your interest. Your list of favorite baseball writers is going to be different than my favorite list, and finding the right twitter personalities, podcasts hosts, and YouTubers can make game analysis more interesting for you even if your team is playing like crap and it's the middle of July.

Here are some common suggestions for some baseball twitter accounts, podcasts, and YouTube Channels that are often recommended by those around the subreddit to get you started, but like I said, find what you like and follow those:

#The Statistical Titans: Baseball Reference and Fangraphs

Literally every day you will find a link or to BaseballReference.com or Fangraphs.com here, it's a given, and it's because these are the two most extensive free baseball databases that are easy to navigate. If you want to look up anything about baseball history, check Baseball Reference, if you want to look up how players stack up with non-proprietary advanced metrics or read an insightful blog post about why someone is overrated/underrated or overperforming/underperforming, check Fangraphs. With these two sites you have all the stats and figures you need to make a competent argument for basically anything you want with a little cherry picking.

A large part of the modern baseball world is statistics and you're going to find yourself getting more immersed in discussing the game if you can get a handle on all the terms getting thrown around. **If you are brand new to baseball, take a little while to get to know the game before diving into these sites**, but if you have a handle on the basics and are ready to know what this WAR everyone is talking about is, dive into the glossaries and find the statistics.

When you get the basics, creating your own analysis doesn't seem as daunting, and one of the reasons I love baseball is that I can deconstruct pretty much every play and find some meaning behind it. If you are like that and enjoy numbers, theoretical projections, and breaking things down into simple figures before reconstructing them into something long and beautiful, then learning the basics of sabrmetrics will make you a baseball fan for life. If, on the other hand, you just want to enjoy the game for the beautiful pastime that it is by watching, then we've got a little bit to go through...

#Advanced Stat Tracking... aka the Stat Junkies' Crack

Fangraphs and Baseball Reference contain almost all the stats you'd need for a lifetime, but sometimes you just need something different, and there are some very helpful places on the internet to find some other, more specific or advanced data.

If you are looking for Pitch f/x data, strikezone plots, and/or a breakdown of a pitcher's pitches, check out [BrookesBaseball.net](http://www.brooksbaseball.net/). You can quickly find specific at bats in games, or entire games scatter plots to ~~ruthlessly ridicule and rant about an umpire~~ see why that last pitch was called a strike.

If you want to look up certain statcast data, like which pitchers are throwing the hardest, which fielders are having the fastest sprint speeds, who's hitting the ball the furthest, etc., you should check out [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/). Look at the ""Statistics"" and ""Leaderboards"" sections for more information.

If you are into looking up really specific historical queries, or just want pretty much every baseball stat ever, you can usually find it in the [Lahman Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).

If you are looking for MLB API for your next coding project, you can [find that information here.](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/) And if you're *really* into statistical analysis and want to test out your R skills, [baseballr is the package of choice.](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)

#Where to Watch? - Your TV and Streaming Guide

So a big part of baseball is, you know, actually being able to watch the games (though as I talk about at the end, it might not necessarily be the case for you, and that doesn't mean you can't enjoy baseball, skip down and see what I'm talking about in the final section).

**TV Networks**

Fox/FS1- ""Baseball Night in America"": exclusive regional coverage of 2 or 3 Saturday night games on the broadcast network starting Memorial Day weekend. Non-exclusive games on the cable network, usually Saturday afternoon with some irregularly scheduled weeknight games as well. Also includes the All-Star Game, both division series and the league championship series for one league (AL in 2023) which are split between OTA and cable channels, and the entire World Series on the broadcast network.

ESPN - Exclusive Sunday Night Baseball game. Usually on ESPN proper, but may get bumped to ESPN2 in the early part of the season because of the NBA and NHL playoffs. None are currently planned, but can also go to ABC as well. Also includes opening night, the Little League Weekend game (which is on a Sunday anyway), the Home Run Derby, a few extra late-season games, and the entire Wild Card round of the playoffs (with some overflow to ABC and ESPN2).

TBS - Non-exclusive Tuesday night game all season. Also includes the other league's division series and league championship series (NL for 2023). Overflow is handled on TNT for the division series.

MLB Network - Simulcasts local home team broadcasts daily; many days they'll have multiple games. About once a week (though irregular as to which day) they have he non-exclusive MLB Network Showcase, which is produced in-house. Simulcasts and the Showcase are subject to blackout in home markets, and another simulcast will be substituted instead.

**Streaming**

Apple TV+ - Two exclusive Friday Night Baseball games produced in conjunction with MLB Network. 

Peacock/NBC - MLB Sunday Leadoff, an exclusive early Sunday game (first few games start at 11:30 am ET, the rest at noon) will air 19 of 20 weeks on Peacock. The May 7th game will be simulcast on NBC.

YouTube - Game of the Week Live on YouTube, an exclusive free stream on the MLB YouTube page. It's usually a Wednesday afternoon game, but day and time may vary. No purchase necessary!

MLB.tv - Subscriber package for watching out-of-town local broadcasts. One game a day is always given as a free sample. Blacked out in the teams' home markets (due to deals between teams and sports networks - it has nothing to do with trying to get you to the ballpark) and for some national broadcasts. See section below for more details.

ESPN+ - One local broadcast a day (not the same game as the freebie on MLB.tv) is simulcast live on ESPN+ in addition to being on MLB.tv. Also on Sundays it simulcasts the Sunday Night Baseball game. More of a throw-in than anything, but if you already have an ESPN+ subscription it's already paid for.

There are also streaming services that grant access to most of the previously mentioned channels: 

 - Sling TV Orange package gets you ESPN, ESPN 2, and TBS. 
 - Sling TV Blue package gets you FOX, FS1, TBS.
 - Youtube TV gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, TBS, and some regional sports networks.
 - HULU Live gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, FS2, TBS, and some regional sports networks.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Live a Little gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, and TBS and your regional sports networks.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Just Right adds MLB Network to the Live a Little channels.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Go Big adds FS2 to the Just Right channels.
 - FUBO Premier gets you FOX, FS1, FS2, ESPN, ESPN 2, and some of your regional sports networks
 - FUBO Extra adds MLB Network

**NOTE - With Bally filing bankruptcy there is an air of unease on what the future of regional sports networks versus direct from MLB streaming is going to look like. Stay tuned around here as news of this kind will be posted and discussed quickly.**

#MLB.TV - the Ultimate Fan Investment

Alright, so a few things to cover with this, first of all YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEGALLY STREAM IN MARKET GAMES IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA. MLB.tv uses your IP address to see where you are located, and if it pings back that you are in a team's home market it will not let you watch the game LIVE. [Here is where you can find what games MLB.tv will black you out from.](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlbtv/help-center/blackout-info.jsp?question=which-teams-am-i-blacked-out-from) National broadcasts on ESPN, FOX, and TBS are also subject to blackouts within the United States (MLB Network games are not). Before you ask, yes there are less than legal ways to get around this (spoofing your IP address, subreddit dedicated to mlb streams, etc.), but I won't be talking about those in detail here. 

**International fans**, the only potential games you will be blacked out of are the Apple TV games and postseason games if your country has a network that paid for postseason broadcasting rights.

Even if you are blacked out, you will be able to watch the game 90 minutes after it finishes, so if you work a late shift or stay up late it might be worth it for you anyways even if you only want to follow one team.

Pricing tip - [if you donate $25 to become a MLB Players Alumni Association Fan Member you get 50% off MLB.tv.](https://www.mlb.com/mlbpaa/membership/fans)

Military members and college students, don't forget to apply your 35% discount! **T-Mobile Customers**, you can get MLB.tv FOR FREE using the T-Mobile Tuesdays App - it has been confirmed that this is back this year but I have not heard an official date yet. 

""But I don't want to watch EVERY out of market game, I just want to watch MY team!"" Cool, for $20 less there's a single team option that will allow you to watch all your team's non-blacked out games! Personally, I'd pay the extra $20 for the opportunity to watch every deGrom, Cole, and Scherzer start, or put the Cubs on in the background while working on a Friday afternoon, but to each their own.

""But I don't want to commit for a full year!"" That's okay, there's a monthly option as well in case you know there are months where you can't watch as much. 

Some of the fun features of MLB.tv include the ability to watch four games at once and quickly swap your audio from one to another (seriously, I'm never on commercial break when I'm watching baseball, unless there's only one game on I'm able to watch it all, and in September that's huge) and condensed games. What are condensed games? They go through and cut out all the time between pitches and innings, meaning if you want to watch a whole game in less than a half hour (or are searching desperately for a play to make a .gif or streamable out of that for some reason isn't considered a highlight) it's really easy. If you're someone who really wants to get into the game but can't figure out how to grind through watching a full game, Condensed Games are great for keeping up with a team while you learn the little details between pitches that somehow make watching the catcher twiddle his fingers exciting for some fans.

**Newly included this year**, the previously separate MiLB.tv has been rolled in to the MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to watch minor league games from across the country! No more debating whether to pay $20 more to watch that one prospect for a week then forget you have the subscription because there are always MLB games on at the same time - access to watching any minor league games is now included! All triple A and double A teams will have their games streamed, and select lower level clubs will as well.

Also, MLB has added some great baseball documentaries to your MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to more than just games. They also have ""Baseball Zen"" videos that are great for relaxing to.

**In addition, there is a great resource to enhance your total immersion into baseball if there are multiple games going on.** Please note you must already be logged into MLB.tv to make them work. Baseball Reference has [Stream Finder](https://www.baseball-reference.com/stream-finder.shtml) which lets you customize your preferences so MLB.tv will always switch to the game that is most relevant to you. This is great if you play fantasy and want to keep up with your players, are waiting for someone to hit a milestone, or if you want to make sure your action is broken into to follow a no-hitter in progress.

MLB.tv also gives you a free subscription to...

#MLB At Bat - The Most Underrated Way to Stay Connected to Baseball

An [MLB At Bat](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/help-center/mlb-audio-is-now-at-bat) subscription gives you access to every team's radio stream for every game during the season and postseason *completely blackout free* across devices. If there's a day game, you can bet I'm listening to it at work, if I'm mowing the lawn on a Saturday I'm listening to a game, when I can't sleep at night, on comes a West Coast game.

Baseball was made to be on the radio, it's a sport that is very easy to follow the action with the right announcer. At work (or school) it's great because you can half listen, and when the announcer gets excited you can instantly tune back in to hear what's going on. This is the most underrated way to stay connected to your team throughout the year. Before I could afford MLB.tv, this was the way to go, and it honestly makes me question every year whether getting the MLB.tv package is worth is when I can get 80% of the entertainment value from listening to the games (and every year I manage to ""forget"" to unsubscribe, for many reasons listed above).

Also, as a nice bonus this year, that MiLB.tv subscription that got rolled into MLB.tv was included in MLB At Bat as well! So if you decide you want to watch some games but don't want to commit to an entire year of MLB.tv, you can catch some upcoming prospects playing in the minors without spending the big bucks.

#How to watch baseball?

So this is a question that we get from many new fans who are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on and why people find this game so fascinating. I'll get the elephant in the room out of the way, yes there are some ""boring"" parts of watching baseball on TV. The camera fans to a batter spitting and adjusting his gloves, the pitcher adjusts his crotch then licks his fingers, random shots of a bored looking manager, etc. When you are actually at the ballpark you can be watching where the catcher and fielders set up to try to predict the pitch that is coming (read *The Hidden Language of Baseball* by Paul Dickson for some great insight into how to interpret this), but on TV it's not usually the case. This is where I have some suggestions for new fans trying to get into it.

First off, if you are looking for just a relaxing day, embrace the slow pace with a beer and veg out on the couch while watching. It's meant to be slow and relaxing (until it gets tense and exciting, usually with runners on). Seriously, when was the last time you just sat and did nothing? Mid July afternoon games are a perfect way to reach that zen of half-consciousness, until something happens to get you sucked into the action.

Another option to stay engaged is keeping score. I find keeping score relaxing and looking back through a scorebook can be fun to see what you were doing a few years ago (except for that damn unfinished scorecard from 2015 where A-Rod hit the most predictable home run in Twins-Yankees history and I sent my scorecard flying to the other side of the room). As NPR once put it, keeping score is a knowledge making activity, and if you have the time and patience for it it is a great way to learn the game. There are [a couple](https://teachbaseball.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/how-to-keep-an-official-scorebook/) different [guides](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/scoring.shtml) to [keeping score](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/baseball_basics/keeping_score.jsp), and most scorebooks/cards will have a brief example of how to do so. If you have any questions, the Around the Horn thread is a great place to ask!

Gamethreads are another way to get together with other baseball fans and pass the time between pitches, especially in team subs you get to know the regulars and conversations start to wonder away from baseball at times throughout the game, and that's fine. Baseball is an excuse to enjoy a summer day.

For those that want to actually understand what is going on during that time, though, there are some options. *Watching Baseball Smarter* by Zack Hample (who despite his reputation on this subreddit knows some stuff and actually pops in from time to time to comment on different things) is a good starting place for new fans. *Baseball for Dummies* and *The Complete Idiots Guide to Baseball* are also good starting points for those willing to sit and read for a little bit.

If it helps, I wrote two posts on /r/minnesotatwins to help newcomers understand some of the nuances of the game:

 - [Watching the Count](https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/ilxdn9/cardith_explains_watching_the_count/)
 - [Bullpen Management](https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/i957mm/offday_post_cardith_explains_bullpen_management/)

#Where to watch highlights and game recaps.

There are many many places to see highlights and game recaps, this is not an exhaustive list, but is a good start.

For highlights, bigger highlights will often be posed here on r/baseball a few minutes after they occur, [if you wish to post them please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/wiki/rules) They also appear relatively quickly on MLB.com in each games Gameday area. For a pretty slick collection of highlights from across MLB, https://baseball.theater/ is a great place to exclusively watch highlights.

There are a few ways to get great game recaps. If you have MLB Network, every day *Quick Pitch* is an hour-long show that recaps every game from the previous day. It usually starts after MLB Tonight (about 10pm EDT) or whatever game MLB Network is showing finishes up, and runs until 10am EDT the next day. MLB.com also puts out recaps of every game by the next morning, usually a 2-5 minutes quick rundown of highlights that can be found on the game recap. It also puts out *Fastcast* videos on youtube and their website every morning which has a brief rundown of all the games from the previous day. [Here's an example of a Fastcast from two seasons ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hWCizeisY)

If you want one concise place to see most of these, /u/efitz11 has been amazing the last few seasons and posted video links to every game recap and fastcast in the daily Around the Horn thread. [Here's an example.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/992tep/general_discussion_around_the_horn_82118/e4kfyr3/?st=jtbm738k&amp;sh=24d221b5) I am unsure if they plan to continue it this year, but it would be surely appreciated!

#TL;DR Finding what you enjoy about the game.

When it boils down to it, baseball is about finding entertainment and enjoyment, and don't let anyone try to tell you how to enjoy baseball. If you want nothing to do with statistical analysis and just want to enjoy what's going on on the field, don't let anyone tell you you aren't enough of a fan, and if you want to dissect a player into their strengths and components using statcast and advanced metrics don't let anyone tell you you're reading into the game too much. You can follow one team, and only one team, or you can follow multiple teams, don't let anyone tell you you're not a true fan for wearing another team's gear or enjoying their games. You might enjoy bat flips and flamboyance, or reserved speedy home run trots. You might not even enjoy physically watching a game (especially not if your team isn't playing), but find yourself loving keeping track of your team through the season and tracking your players or maybe just the thrill of the standings race and scoreboard watching or maybe you just love all the numbers that get thrown around and arguing about their relevancy. That's okay, eventually I believe enjoyment of the game itself will come, but even if it doesn't, the long baseball season is still creating a place of enjoyment for you, *and that's what matters*. If you have any questions, once again, feel free to ask them in our daily Around the Horn thread, or below in the comments, or if you really want to feel free to PM with questions and I'd be happy to answer.

So watch games this week and join in the discussion here, you'll naturally find yourself gravitating towards certain players or teams and enjoying different aspects of the game. Baseball is a long season, find what you enjoy, stick to it, dwell on it, and enjoy it.

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Anyone who knows the Trop knows Fergs, the magical land connected by underpass to the cathedral itself. I believe it meets the 7 requirements for life. Movement - in the style of plants, the layout shifts to accomodate events. Respiration - it's basically outdoors but still has cooling systems to filter air. Excretion - all that bar and patron waste has to go somewhere. Growth - this veritable shantytown has clearly expanded itself, every time I go there's something new. Sensitivity - some parts move when touched and return when left alone, such as the stairs. Reproduction - though not franchised, I believe the (listed) 11 sections function as a colony of organisms, the others had to spawn from somewhere. If you've imagined it, Fergs probably has it. Also the Rays won 6 games this week, 5 against first place teams. |**48-21**
**2**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| Well if you are going to be the best you have to beat the best and while the series was competitive the Rangers lost 2 of the 3 games against the Rays. With deGrom officially out for Tommy John guys like Eovaldi, Gray, and Perez will have to carry the load for this pitching staff. Bullpen minus one Spencer Howard has been improving lately which has been nice. |**41-24**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| One of the most encouraging weeks in terms of results in a long time. We swept the Mets in spectacular fashion and took the series from the gnats. 5-1 on the week and our starting rotation didn't even have a great week. Good teams find a way to win. We are a good team. |**40-26**
**4**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+2**| Well last week when I wrote about the upcoming schedule, I said I hoped we would go 4-2, we went 4-2. I'll be honest, I looked at Sundays lineup and thought it was not even close to a winning lineup. Then O'Hearn in the cleanup spot went 3 for 3 with a HR, Hicks continued to rake going 2 for 4 with 2 doubles, Urias went 4 for 5 with 2 doubles and Josh Lester went 2 for 4 with 2 RBI. Henderson seemed to get more confident in the leadoff spot and hit a 462 ft HR yesterday that one bounced the warehouse. I know the fan base is really pulling for a huge move at the deadline (Bieber, Cease, Stroman) and those would be big, but I think they might get more worth out of someone like Paul Blackburn, which would not cost nearly as much capital. Just a thought. 3rd best record in all baseball 60+ games in. It might be a fun summer. |**41-24**
**5**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+4**| The Snakes didn't lose a game all week, taking two games from the Nationals before having the third postponed, and then sweeping the Tigers in Detroit. The offense, defense, and baserunning is all good as hell, but the starting pitching is still a queestion mark going forward, as even the NL's best pitcher by fWAR, Zac Gallen, is having a rough stretch.  |**41-25**
**6**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| A rough start to the month for the Dodgers, losing 4 of their last 5 series including back to back walkoff losses to the Reds, leaving them 3.5 games back from the sneks. Kershaw and Bobby Miller have been keeping the team afloat as of late being probably the only consistent pitchers on the team recently. Thor has a ""blister"" on his finger and is on the IL. I mean I feel bad for the guy but he really just didn't have it and should not be on the mound (ERA of 7.16 on the season). P.S. Bobby Miller is the new hot rookie Dodger and you should watch him pitch.  |**37-29**
**7**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-3**| Where is Yordan? Is he safe? Is he alright? I'd like to be spoiled with a healthy team again. I will say, it's been interesting watching the collective fanbase melt down over not being a total juggernaut this year for the first time since 2016 ish. I'm not sure we know how to act when times are hard anymore.  |**37-29**
**8**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-1**| This offense becomes painful to watch without Aaron Judge, and the Yankees have taken back-to-back series losses as a result. The division just seems to keep getting tougher and tougher, especially with the Blue Jays surging again. Dropping 2/3 to Boston didnt help that. Anemic offense aside, the pitching has stayed consistently very good, and it may be getting even better with Carlos Rodon *actually* expected to begin a rehab assignment soon.  |**38-29**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| Solid week for the Jays. I believe we have a better future than Reddit, which is saying... well, very little. Took 3 of 4 from the defending champstros before stealing just one in a frustrating series vs MIN after the most clutch 3-run HR ever was hit by Cavan Biggio. (Can that be right...? checks notes Wow. Okay.) We sent our troubled big boy Manoah down to our grandparents' house in Florida after he gave up 6 runs in 0.1 innings, removed a fake Christian bigot tumor named Anthony Bass, and saw Jose Berrios continue his surprisingly shocking return to solid form. This season has fit an entire Taylor Swift relationship's worth of drama into the first two months, and I, for one, want things to calm the fuck down. Series incoming @ Our Bird Bros and @ the Texas Yee-Haws. |**37-30**
**10**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+4**| Zach Neto is a perfect rebound-relationship guy. He seems perfectly fine at face value, but then you get to spending time with him. Time that passes without you even feeling it. Day in and day out he's there for you, checking in with a wake-up text -- surprising you with some Cane's after a tough day at work. Sometimes you have to stop youself and take notice, how did you find such a guy? Is he the product of low expectations brought upon by tragic heartbreak? No, he's just a guy who does the little things well and handles the big moments with grace. Is...is this turning into something more?  |**37-31**
**11**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-1**| The two biggest flaws of the team so far are that we're the most strikeout-prone team in the majors, and we're great at losing close games. Even though we were swept by the Rays, the games were at least competitive. The lineup *finally* showed signs of life in Toronto though and won that series, so hopefully we're about to pick up steam. |**33-33**
**12**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+5**|  |**37-30**
**13**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**0**| Andrew McCutchen got his 2,000th hit, Mitch Keller finally had a good start after a few rough outings in a row, and Ke'Bryan Hayes appears to be heating up at the plate. The Bucs may have lost 2 of 3 to the A's this week, but the team ahead of them in the standings on Friday got swept by Oakland and now the Pirates are back in first place. The Athletics might be leading the division if they played in the NL Central, but they don't  which means the upstart Bucs are holding onto that spot for now.  |**34-30**
**14**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-3**|  |**34-32**
**15**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+3**| The Giants had a nice 4 -2 week because were pretending Monday and Tuesdays game havent happened yet. A sweep of the Rockies, before dropping 2 of 3 to the Cubs. But hey, they always say if youre gonna win one game in a series -- make it the last one. Momentum. Ah shit, Hanniger and JD possibly IL. Wait Im not supposed to know about that. IM FROM THE FUTURE AND ALL MY NEWS IS BAD. Except the Giants are in the process of winning on the road. Guess who has two thumbs and is currently on a plane? Luis Matos. Presumably. I really dont know how many thumbs he has. |**34-32**
**16**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-4**| The past two weeks have been particularly painful for Boston, featuring a lot of bad BABIP luck for our already slumping offense alongside a slew of embarassing goofs and/or gaffes on defense. The pitching has been slightly better, only giving up 4.3 runs/game in June compared to 5.0 in April/May, but the bats need to be on point if you want to be competitive with mediocre pitching. The Sox have been .500 fifteen times this season (at 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 30, 31, 32, and 33 wins/losses), and it seems like that's where we'll stay without Story/Sale in the mix. But hey, we took 2/3 from the Yankees in New York, that's a win right? |**33-34**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+2**| The Padres havent lost any of their last four seriess, so thats good, right? Blake Snell has been genuinely good his last four starts, with only 2 earned runs in 24 innings. He seems to do this every year; starting slow, and building as the season goes on. Padres hose the Guardians for a series, then the mighty Rays, as they try to keep up with DBacks&who are leading the division?? |**31-34**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| 2-3 on the week - better than last week, but that's a cold comfort. They're not quite at the point of needing another 14-game win streak to get back in it, but time is starting to run out. It's also looking more and more likely that the M's won't have a single starter at the All-Star Game they're hosting. Up next: 3 vs. Florida Men (NL), 3 vs. Bleached Socks |**32-33**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+2**| What a great week it was to be a Phillies fan! After getting swept by the Mets and losing the series opener to the Nationals, the season looked grim. Then, the Phillies won 7 of 8 including a sweep of the Tigers and 2/3 from the Dodgers. Taijuan Walker, Aaron Nola, and Zack Wheeler all had incredible starts in the Tigers series, with Nola and Wheeler entering the 7th and 8th innings respectively with no-hitters. Kyle Schwarber hit another 2 dingers including a walkoff, while Trea Turner finally looked like himself, raising his OPS 45 points this week. Alec Bohm and Jose Alvarado both returned from brief IL stints, while Darick Hall and Cristian Pache both are finishing up rehab assignments. I seem to say it most weeks but Nick Castellanos continues to be the Phillies best hitter, with his OPS 162 points higher than last year. This week, a west coast road trip with 4 in Arizona and 3 against the red hot Oakland Athletics. |**32-34**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| I look at three factors when determining my rankings: record, run differential, and how a team has done against teams over 500. There are A LOT of teams under 500. Anyway, the Guardians haven't been doing badly lately. They've won four of their last five series and split the other one. Are they turning the corner? Or am I just getting false hope? You never know with baseball. |**31-34**
**21**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-5**| It's over. We are back. It's so over. We are so back. It's fucking over. We are fucking back. It's so fucking over. We are so fucking back. It never even began. We never left. |**31-35**
**22**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| Elly De La Cruz has come and so have I. Call your doctor cause this puppy is lasting a lot longer than 4 hours. Seriously can someone please call my doctor, its been 4 days now and I have to go to my kids baseball game tomorrow. Anyway, Elly De La Cruz is here to absolve us of all our sins. He has cometh into our homes to wash away all transgressions and deliver unto us our time of wonder. For Elly De La Cruz is him, he is the prophet set to save us all from the clutches of the Catellini's and lead us into salvation. Elly De La Cruz has brought onto us good baseball and fun, something that has been absent for years. Oh glorious days, Hallelujah we are saved. And god said on the fourth day let there be Elly and there was. And he said on the fifth day let there speed, and Elly gained speed. And he said on the sixth day let there be power, and Elly gained power. He hath flown down from the heavens and blessed thee. He reached out to touch thee and emanating from thine finger was the holy spirit, upon contact Cincinnati witnessed miracles of divine proportion. And Elly asked if thee had been saved and thee responded lord yes thine have. And Elly floated back to the palace of God and it rained for forty days and forty nights, and when the waters subsided there was but only joy. Elly De La Cruz has arrived.   |**32-35**
**23**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-1**| Fresh off of a week that showed promise, the Cubs squandered it by going 2-5. Kyle Hendricks' no hit bid was a pleasant surprise, but the day was marred by reports that the Cubs FO wasn't involved in extension talks with Marcus Stroman. |**28-37**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-1**| Fire John Mozeliak. |**27-40**
**25**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**+1**| The White Sox were on pace to win both series of the week en route to a 4-2 record. Then, two relievers who hadn't given up a run since APRIL both imploded in the 8th and 9th and blew a 5-1 lead. Just emblamatic of this team, who also placed Hendriks on the IL Sunday with elbow inflamation. |**29-38**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Given the big club is relatively poopy, let's take a look at JAMES WOOD JAMES WOOD JAMES WOOD. Dude is a giant OF at 6'7 and is heating up in AA Harrisburg. He's currently hitting 11-37 with 7XBH (4-2B and 3-HR) and made a spectacular catch up against the fence in CF. There's still some swing &amp; miss in his game, but he's exciting for sure. |**26-38**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**+1**| The Rockies went 1-5 this week, including multiple games where the bullpen blew a lead late, but it ended with Ryan McMahon and Nolan Jones hitting some of the longest homers this year so I'm kind of in a good mood for the moment. |**28-40**
**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-3**| 0-for-June, yikes. As the outfield injuries keep racking up, the rest of the lineup is nowhere to be found. Can't really say anything positive about the big squad, but at least it looks like Tarik Skubal's return is coming soon and he's been racking up punchies in his rehab starts. Finally something to look forward to! This week: 3 vs. ATL, 4 at MIN. |**27-37**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| *Note from Jack: Please consider donating to your local food bank, animal shelter, or worthy nearby charity. Every dollar can help someone in need* |**18-48**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| Look, I'm not saying the A's are good again but after five straight wins vs. NL Central teams, I think all the midwest teams suck profoundly and the only real baseball is played on the coasts.  |**18-50**","baseball",51,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/148zukg/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_11_angels/"
"2022-11-27",1669558018,"Which players do r/baseball think that r/baseball wont think about? An analysis","Theres a certain kind of thread on r/baseball I typically hate. The sort of thread where every reply is just the name of a player. No discussion, no conversation, just name some guys. But a few days ago, I made one of those threads, but I wanted to make it interesting. Here was the title - perhaps you saw it:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If you had to name a player that nobody else would name to answer this question, who would it be?


&amp;nbsp;

At first, I kept track of who was named and told people when they had lost when a duplicate was posted. At around 300 comments, I gave up. But then the next day, I realized I had a wonderful data set to analyze. Who does r/baseball think that r/baseball wont think about? The answer might surprise you!

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, 351 of the 1092 replies were duplicates, or 32%. Its apparently relatively difficult to name players nobody else has named. Perhaps theres a bit of the birthday paradox going on, but I get the feeling many of you arent picking completely randomly. 

&amp;nbsp;

Lets begin with the answers that were not duplicates. As a rule, if you picked a guy from before the 1970s who didnt have a funny name, you were completely safe. Im not going to list every non-duplicate, since theres ~700 of them - just the interesting ones! Lets start with the Not Real Baseball Players:

* Tungsten Arm ODoyle
* Pat Mahomes*
* Randy Moss
* Tiger Woods
* Bobson Dugnutt
* Mario McRlwain
* Sleve McDichael
* Todd Bonzalez
* Bucky McBadBat
* Henry Rowengartner

Now, I never specified that the player people named had to be real, or even a baseball player, so these are borderline acceptable. Credit to the four people who named Fighting Baseball characters, since they managed to name four *different* Fighting Baseball characters.

 (there could be other Not Real Baseball Players, but Im not looking up every single player on this list)

^^\*One ^^person ^^said ^^Pat ^^Mahomes ^^Sr, ^^and ^^someone ^^else ^^said ^^Pat ^^Mahomes. ^^I ^^made ^^an ^^executive ^^call ^^that ^^person ^^2 ^^was ^^probably ^^talking ^^about ^^the ^^football ^^Pat ^^Mahomes, ^^and ^^thus ^^its ^^not ^^a ^^duplicate. ^^Person ^^2, ^^if ^^you ^^were ^^thinking ^^of ^^Mahomes ^^Sr, ^^please ^^let ^^me ^^know ^^so ^^I ^^can ^^inform ^^you ^^and ^^the ^^other ^^guy ^^that ^^you ^^both ^^have ^^lost. 


The Hall of Famers: every player named who was in the MLB Hall of Fame as a player was safe: 

* Babe Ruth
* Derek Jeter
* Jim Thome
* Larry Walker
* Mickey Mantle
* Mike Piazza
* Phil Rizzuto
* Rod Carew
* Rollie Fingers

* Zack Wheat

7x:

* Tony Eusebio (""Tony Eusebio, 24 game hit streak over 45 games."")

&amp;nbsp;

Please, if anyone can explain this, go ahead. I first thought there must have been some Tony Eusebio-based reddit thread lately - couldnt find one (The Only Nolan and Oil Can Boyd both had one). Then I figured there was a Foolish Baseball video, or some equivalent, on Eusebio. Couldnt find one. Is he just the perfect player where people remember him, but assume other people wont?  Did that hit streak stick in your mind for a lot of you? He doesnt have the fun name of Pokey Reese, Darwin Barney, Chone Figgins, or Doug Mientkiewicz, or the WS game-tying hit of Tony Womack. Eusebios just& a guy. Perhaps thats why so many of you thought nobody else would think of him.","baseball",58,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/z622b1/which_players_do_rbaseball_think_that_rbaseball/"

I post arcane stats and trivia all year, often on a whim, when some random comment inspires me to waste an afternoon deep-diving bizarre and irrelevant details. Few of those efforts are included here; this is just something I've always done at the conclusion of the last game, not just here but in any place I've talked about baseball. These days there are a million trivia goons and not much of this is news to anyone, but baseball is a game powered by tradition and this post is my tradition.

**Teams**

* The New York Yankees posted their 31st consecutive winning season, and are approaching the major-league record of 39 seasons set by the Yankees of 1926-64. Only 15 out of 53 men on the Yankees' roster this year were born before this stretch began.
* The Los Angeles Dodgers also upped their current streak of winning seasons to 13.
* Three teams won 100 or more games this season, down from four in 2022. The Dodgers now have 11 seasons with at least 100 wins, the most among National League franchises.
* The St. Louis Cardinals ended their streak of winning seasons at 15, tied for the longest in National League history.
* Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Angels posted a losing season for the eighth consecutive year. The Royals have also gone eight years without a winning season, including a .500 effort in 2016. The longest stretch of losing seasons is the 1993-2013 Pirates.
* Four teams lost at least 100 games this year, the fourth straight year there have been that many. There has never been a season with five 100-loss teams.
* Of those 100-loss teams, the Colorado Rockies set their franchise record in that column with 103. The Oakland Athletics' 112 losses are the most for that club since 1916.
* Both the Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles reached 10,000 franchise losses. The Dodgers began play nearly two decades before the Orioles. The Orioles, however, also won their 9,000th game, and the Atlanta Braves won their 11,000th.
* The Atlanta Braves hit 307 home runs as a team, the most in National League history.
* Thanks to the new schedule, the Toronto Blue Jays became the first team since 1900 to win a game against every other existing major-league franchise.

**Players**

* The oldest player in baseball this year was Rich Hill, born March 11, 1980. *Pac-Man* and *The Empire Strikes Back* had not yet been released, and the Philadelphia Phillies had yet to win a World Series. Hill is also the last active player who is older than me.
* The youngest player in baseball this year was Junior Caminero, born July 5, 2003. Saddam Hussein had already been deposed, and Miguel Cabrera was in his rookie year. Caminero plays for the Tampa Bay Rays, the newest MLB franchise, which began operations five years before he was born.
* Four players appeared in every game this year. Of these, Matt Olson also appeared in every game last year, and the final 134 games of 2021. This makes him the current Iron Man leader with 458 consecutive games played. Assuming no changes to the schedule, Olson will surpass Cal Ripken with his 2,633rd game played in June 2037, at the age of 43.
* There were four no-hitters thrown this year, including Domingo German's perfect game, the first such feat in eleven years. There were also four no-nos last season.
* Five players hit for the cycle in 2023, which also matches last year's total.
* Ronald Acuna Jr.'s OBP of .4163 is the lowest league-leading OBP since 2014.
* Acuna notched 217 hits, which is the *most* since 2014.
* He also scored 149 runs, which is the most since 2000.
* And his 73 stolen bases are the most since 2007.
* Acuna is the first player to steal at least 70 bases and hit at least 40 home runs in the same season. As a result, his power/speed number of 52.51 is, by a wide margin, the highest in the history of baseball.
* Marcus Semien collected 753 plate appearances, the most since 2010.
* Freddie Freeman smacked 59 doubles, the most since 2000.
* Matt Olson's 139 RBI are the most since 2012.
* Ty France was hit by 34 pitches this year, the most since 1997.
* Carlos Correa hit into 30 double plays, the most since 2014.
* Spencer Strider, the league's only 20-game winner, compiled a W-L% of .800, which is the lowest for a league leader since 2010.
* Gerrit Cole's .981 WHIP was the highest league-leading ratio since 2012.
* Lance Lynn surrendered 44 home runs, the most since 2011.
* Blake Snell handed out 99 walks, the most since 2012.
* Jordan Lyles allowed 124 earned runs, the highest mark since 2007.
* No pitcher achieved 15 wild pitches this year, for the first time in a full season since 1997.
* Sonny Gray posted a FIP of 2.82, which is the worst league-leading FIP since 2007.
* Nathaniel Lowe led the majors in putouts, with 1215 (through yesterday). This is the lowest league-leading number of putouts for a non-shortened season since 1960.
* Similarly, Nico Hoerner collected 411 assists (through yesterday), which is the lowest for a full season since 1883. Assists and putouts have been trending downward for years.
* Trea Turner committed 23 errors and ""led"" the league. The only season in major-league history where the league leader made fewer than 23 errors was 2020.

**Postseason**

* Six teams in this year's postseason were also in last year's postseason, the same amount of carryover as last year.
* The Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers have each earned their first postseason berth since 2016, and the Arizona Diamondbacks are in for the first time since 2017.
* Meanwhile, it's the eleventh straight October for the Dodgers. The Yankees had a streak of 13 years from 1995-2007; the Braves went 14 straight in a stretch that was interrupted by the 1994 strike.
* The longest postseason droughts remain the Los Angeles Angels and Detroit Tigers, both of whom last made the playoffs in 2014. Every franchise has played extra baseball at least once in the past ten seasons.
* The Twins do not have a significant postseason appearance drought, but their current streak of 18 consecutive postseason losses is the longest in the history of professional sports.
* Of the postseason field, the Rangers have waited the longest for a world championship, having never won one since their franchise inception in Washington in 1961. The Brewers and Rays are also metal-less. The longest active championship drought of any team is still the Cleveland Guardians' 75 years.
* The Brewers have not even reached the World Series since 1982; the Orioles have waited since 1983. The longest active pennant drought of any team is that of the Seattle Mariners, who have never captured the league's flag in their 46-year history.
* There are seven expansion teams in this year's postseason bracket; this is the most ever. For the first time, every year of expansion is represented. Six out of eight of the first-round competitors will be expansion teams.
* From 1978-87, no team won the World Series more than once. The current streak is five, and can be extended to six if anyone other than the Astros, Braves, or Dodgers win it all.
* The Astros are hoping to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. If they draw the Phillies it would be the first repeat World Series matchup since 1977-78.
* Four AL contenders have already faced the Dodgers in the World Series, and two (the Orioles and Astros) have defeated them).

**Potential World Series rematches:**

* Astros over Dodgers (2017), Phillies (2022)
* Blue Jays over Braves (1992), Phillies (1993)
* Braves over Astros (2021)
* Dodgers over Twins (1965), Rays (2020)
* Orioles over Dodgers (1966), Phillies (1983)
* Phillies over Rays (2008)
* Twins over Braves (1991)

**Most recent championships among the postseason field:**

* Astros 2022
* Braves 2021
* Dodgers 2020
* Phillies 2008
* Marlins 2003
* Diamondbacks 2001
* Rays *never* (enfranchised 1998)
* Blue Jays 1993

"2023-01-04",1672844652,"[OC] The Most Meaningless Game of 2022","Deep in the cold offseason, we huddle around our bonfires and reminisce over the baseball season gone by. We recall all the dramatic moments, the impossible rallies, the fantastic individual performances, and the record pursuits. But often we let our memories of the few dull games and tedious moments slip into nothingness. I'm here to correct that.  

There were 2,430 regular-season games played in 2022. With this post, I hope to identify which one was the MOST MEANINGLESS.  

Before we begin, I just want to state that obviously Im not including postseason games in this exercise. All postseason games are massively important in the grand scheme of teams pursuing a championship. And Im also ignoring Spring Training and any other exhibition games. I want to find out which *regular-season game* was the least important.  

Now let's start.   

#Something to Play For  

First, I'm going to eliminate all games in which a team had *something to play for.* This includes competing for: a division title, a wild card spot, homefield advantage in the playoffs, and higher playoff seeding. All remaining games move on to the next round in the hunt for MOST MEANINGLESS GAME.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Team|Date of Final Meaningful Game|Remaining Meaningless Games  
:--|:--|:--|
Angels|September 19|15|
Astros|September 30|5|
Athletics|September 7|25|
Blue Jays|October 3|2|
Braves|October 4|1|
Brewers|October 3|2|

Mets|October 4|1|
Nationals|September 6|24|
Orioles|September 30|5|
Padres|October 4|1|
Phillies|October 3|2|
Pirates|September 10|24|

Royals|September 15|18|
Tigers|September 13|20|
Twins|September 25|9|
Yankees|September 30|6|
White Sox|September 25|9|

&amp;nbsp;  


The bulk of regular-season games (94%) have been eliminated. 

Now it's time to sift through these ""meaningless games"" to remove any that were meaningful to the opposing team. For example, just because the October 3 game was meaningless to the Astros doesn't mean it was also meaningless for their opponent, the Phillies.

The preliminary work is over. None of these games have playoff implications whatsoever. Now I must comb through them looking for any traces of meaning.  

Note: Many games fit in multiple categories below. I tried to list each one with the best fit, but you'll see several games that could've been eliminated from the MOST MEANINGLESS competition for multiple reasons.  

#Noteworthy Personal Performance  

These games featured a player with a noteworthy or career-best performance. I tried to be critical here and only remove games with truly great performances, not merely good ones. These games have meaning for fans cheering for the specific player or for the player themselves to grow confidence, earn playing time, or add to their career achievements.  

For pitchers, I'm looking for a Game Score over 75.  
For batters, I'm looking for 8+ total bases.  

**Sept. 18 Marlins vs. Nationals** (Sandy Alcantara, 9.0 IP, 7 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 7 K)  
**Sept. 24 Nationals vs. Marlins** (Alcantara, 8 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 11 K &amp; De La Cruz 4-4, 3 XBH)  
**Sept. 24 Cubs vs. Pirates** (Johan Oviedo, 7.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 7 K)  
**Sept. 27 White Sox vs. Twins** (Bailey Ober, 7.1 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 10 K)    
**Sept. 28 Reds vs. Pirates** (Bryse Wilson, 8.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 6 K)  
**Sept. 29 Athletics vs. Angels** (Shohei Ohtani, 8.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 10 K)  
**Oct. 1 Orioles vs. Yankees** (Nestor Cortes, 7.1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 12 K)  
**Oct. 3 Yankees vs. Rangers** (Luis Severino, 7.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 7 K)  
**Oct. 3 Cubs vs. Reds** (Hunter Greene, 6.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 8 K)  
**Oct. 4 Diamondbacks vs. Brewers** (Eric Lauer, 6.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 4 BB, 7 K)  
**Oct. 4 Phillies vs. Astros** (Justin Verlander, 5.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 10 K)  
**Oct. 5 Giants vs. Padres** (David Villar, 2-4, 2 HR)  

#Record Pursuits  

I'm going to eliminate any games in which a team or player was chasing a positive franchise or league record. Historical records are fun and give fans a reason to watch.  

**Sept. 30 Pirates vs. Cardinals** (Albert Pujols career HR total chase)  
**Oct. 1 Pirates vs. Cardinals** (Albert Pujols career HR total chase)  
**Oct. 1 Rockies vs. Dodgers** (Dodgers win record chase)  
**Oct. 2 Orioles vs. Yankees** (Aaron Judge HR pursuit)  
**Oct. 2 Rockies vs. Dodgers** (Dodgers win record chase)  
**Oct. 2 Pirates vs. Cardinals** (Albert Pujols career HR total chase)  
**Oct. 3 Rockies vs. Dodgers** (Dodgers win record chase)  
**Oct. 3 Cardinals vs. Pirates** (Albert Pujols passes Babe Ruth in RBI)  
**Oct. 4 Yankees vs. Rangers (1)** (Aaron Judge HR pursuit)  
**Oct. 4 Yankees vs. Rangers (2)** (Aaron Judge HR pursuit)  
**Oct. 4 Rockies vs. Dodgers** (Dodgers win record chase)  
**Oct. 5 Rockies vs. Dodgers** (Dodgers win record chase)  

#Saying Goodbye  

Games in which fans have the opportunity to say goodbye to long-time players or managers have meaning. So I'll cross these games off as well.  

**Oct. 2 Reds vs. Cubs** (Willson Contreras final game at Wrigley)  
**Oct. 4 Twins vs. White Sox** (Jose Abreus final game with the White Sox)  
**Oct. 4 Cardinals vs. Pirates** (Albert Pujols final career game)   
**Oct. 5 Cardinals vs. Pirates** (Yadier Molina final career game)  
**Oct. 5 Braves vs. Marlins** (Don Mattingly's final game as manager of Marlins)   
**Oct. 5 Rays vs. Red Sox** (Xander Bogaerts final game with the Red Sox)    

#MLB Debuts  

These games saw a player make his MLB debut. It's a neat little historical moment, even if only his friends and family celebrate. Im going to cross these out as well.  

**Sept. 13 Pirates vs. Reds** (Luis Ortiz)   
**Sept. 23 Cubs vs. Pirates** (Ji Hwan Bae)  
**Sept. 28 Athletics vs. Angels** (Logan O'Hoppe)  
**Oct. 1 Twins vs. Tigers** (Brendon Davis)  
**Oct. 1 Royals vs. Guardians** (Bo Naylor)  
**Oct. 2 Twins vs. Tigers** (Simeon Woods Richardson)  
**Oct. 4 Angels vs. Athletics** (Nate Mondou)  
**Oct. 5 Yankees vs. Rangers** (Yerry Rodriguez)  
**Oct. 5 Angels vs. Athletics** (Nash Walters)  

#Award Finalists  

I'm eliminating these games since they featured a player building their case for a major year-end award. These games have meaning because winning awards is noteworthy and can impact future Hall of Fame voting. I'm looking specifically for top-5 finishes.  
 
**Sept. 20 Angels vs. Rangers** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Sept. 21 Angels vs. Rangers** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Sept. 22 Angels vs. Rangers** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)   
**Sept. 27 Athletics vs. Angels** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Sept. 27 Royals vs. Tigers** (Bobby Witt Jr., 4th place ROY finish)    
**Sept. 29 Royals vs. Tigers** (Bobby Witt Jr., 4th place ROY finish)    
**Sept. 30 Rangers vs. Angels** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Sept. 30 Royals vs. Guardians** (Steven Kwan, 3rd place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 1 Rangers vs. Angels** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Oct. 2 Rangers vs. Angels** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Oct. 2 Royals vs. Guardians** (José Ramírez, 4th place MVP finish)   
**Oct. 2 Diamondbacks vs. Giants** (Jake McCarthy, 5th place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 3 Angels vs. Athletics** (Shohei Ohtani, 2nd place MVP finish)  
**Oct. 3 Royals vs. Guardians** (Steven Kwan, 3rd place ROY finish)   
**Oct. 4 Royals vs. Guardians** (Steven Kwan, 3rd place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 5 Phillies vs. Astros** (Alvarez, 3rd place MVP finish AND Valdez, 5th place CY finish)    
**Oct. 5 Tigers vs. Mariners** (Julio Rodríguez, 1st place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 5 Blue Jays vs. Orioles (1)** (Adley Rutschman, 2nd place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 5 Royals vs. Guardians** (Steven Kwan, 3rd place ROY finish)  
**Oct. 5 Diamondbacks vs. Brewers** (Jake McCarthy, 5th place ROY finish)  

&amp;nbsp;  

We're down to **24 games** remaining, so now I've gotta get serious to narrow down the field further.  

#Something Interesting Happened  

I'm looking for any interesting piece of history, a season's accomplishment, something exciting or notable fans may remember witnessing when theyre old.    

Is there any meaningful memory to be taken from these games?     

**Sept. 14 Pirates vs. Reds** (Completed Pirates first 4-game sweep in Cincinnati since 1991)  
**Sept. 16 Marlins vs. Nationals** (Joey Meneses hit an inside-the-park home run!)  
**Sept. 19 Cubs vs. Marlins** (Bryan De La Cruz hit a grand slam!)  
**Sept. 20 Cubs vs. Marlins** (At age 30, Esteban Quiroz collects first two hits of his MLB career.)  
**Sept. 21 Cubs vs. Marlins** (Marlins had a 92% win exp. in the 7th, but Cubs rally to win.)  
**Sept. 22 Cubs vs. Pirates** (Hayden Wesneski throws an immaculate inning!)   
**Sept. 28 White Sox vs. Twins** (Capped off Chicago's longest losing streak of the year)  
**Sept. 28 Royals vs. Tigers** (Miguel Cabrera hits HR no. 507)  
**Sept. 30 Twins vs. Tigers** (Twins pitch a shutout)  
**Oct. 3 Twins vs. White Sox** (Tony La Russa steps down + White Sox win!)  
**Oct. 4 Cubs vs. Reds** (Cincinnati with the walk-off win!)  
**Oct. 5 Cubs vs. Reds** (Cubs bat around in TWO separate innings)  
**Oct. 5 Twins vs. White Sox** (Luis Arraez wins the AL batting title!)  
**Oct. 5 Blue Jays vs. Orioles (2)** (Orioles fans give team standing ovation for winning season.)  
**Oct. 5 Nationals vs. Mets** (Mets win their 101st game, the most by the franchise since 1988.)  

#Rookies    
 
For teams out of the pennant race, the end of the season is a chance to get a look at your young talent and give them a taste of the show. Can we find a little more meaning in our remaining games based on the number of rookies who got to play?  

**Sept. 17 Marlins vs. Nationals** (9 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 23 Nationals vs. Marlins** (9 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 25 Cubs vs. Pirates** (14 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 25 Nationals vs. Marlins** (12 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 26 Reds vs. Pirates** (12 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 27 Reds vs. Pirates** (11 rookies played!)  
**Sept. 30 Reds vs. Cubs** (10 rookies played!)   
**Oct. 1 Reds vs. Cubs** (12 rookies played!)  

#The Most Meaningless Game of 2022  

=¨=¨=¨  

**Sept. 29 White Sox vs. Twins**   

At noon local time on a cool Thursday in Minnesota, two eliminated teams faced off with nothing to play for. No player who finished in the top-5 in MVP, Cy Young, or Rookie of the Year voting appeared. No records were being sought. No legends saying goodbye. Only a few rookies got to play, and no one made their MLB debut. There were no outstanding performances. In fact, no batter even hit a home run. And no pitcher went deeper than 5 innings. No reliever struck out the side. There were an annoying 10 pitching changes made for some reason though. Attendance was poor, and the home team lost. 

It was a game. It did take place. And I declare it the most meaningless game of 2022.","baseball",303,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1035rp6/oc_the_most_meaningless_game_of_2022/"

"2023-02-05",1675557359,"I had a theory that former Phillies GM Matt Klentak signed a disproportionate number of guys with two first names, so I analyzed all 30 MLB rosters over the last 16 years to see if I was right","I certainly don't expect everyone to read this whole thing so here's TLDR for those who are curious but don't want to read the whole post. Major conclusions marked as spoilers for those who want to read the full text without knowing the ending first. In short:

1. In 2020 I felt like the team had way more players with first names for last names (two first name guys or 2FN guys) than you'd expect, e.g. Jay Bruce, Spencer Howard, Blake Parker, Nick Vincent, etc. So I downloaded every Fangraphs player season from 20072022 and analyzed how common 2FN guys were on all 30 teams during that time. I came to several conclusions:
2. &gt;!Did Matt Klentak's Phillies teams have more 2FN guys than other teams in the league? Yes (Tables 1 and 2)!&lt;
3. &gt;!Why? 2FN guys are not correlated with winning (Fig. 1 and 2), so it's not that. The last great Phillies team had only slightly more 2FN guys than average, BUT they were anchored in part by two 2FN guys (Ryan Howard, Cliff Lee). Maybe Klentak kept signing 2FN guys trying to find the next Ryan Howard or Cliff Lee? Maybe he ""succeeded"" by signing Bryce Harper?!&lt;
4. &gt;!Only one other GM has followed the same 2FN-obsessed path as KlentakBen Cherington, most notably of the 2012-15 Red Sox. What happened after he left Boston? They hired Dave Dombrowski, lost to the Astros in the playoffs two years later, and won the World Series the year after that. The Phillies have followed that same pattern in the first two years, so we can only assume the Phillies will win the World Series in 2023.!&lt;

# Introduction: How Lockdowns and A Lockouts Begot A Klenspiracy Theory

So I've had this pet theory going back to the 2020 season that former Phillies General Manager Matt Klentak, for some reason, really liked packing the roster with guys who have first names for last names, aka have two first names. Stuck at home, going stir crazy during lockdown with nothing to do but watch the worst bullpen in a generation, I watched yet another Phillies team do well enough to get me *just* invested enough that my heart was crushed every time they found new ways to lose (e.g. giving up an inside the park home run AND dropping a pop up to the mound for a two run infield single in *the same game against the Orioles*.

Naturally, I was searching for any explanation as to how this had happened to a team which was supposed to have had such promise. And, like many Philadelphians, I turned my attention to Matt Klentak. What was the plan here? Other than the big signings/trades for Harper, Wheeler, and JT, what was he doing to prevent us from becoming the Angels of the East? So I looked up everyone he had acquired since signing Bryce Harper going into the 2019 season and I noticed...it seemed like a weird number of these guys had last names for first namesJay Bruce, Nick Vincent, Neil Walker, Blake Parker, Trevor Kelley, plus other players who were already around like Adam Morgan, Tommy Hunter, Drew Anderson, etc. Surely people with two first names like this aren't that common, are they? I looked up the rosters of a few random teams and found &lt;5 players per roster with two first names, so I texted my friend about it and tried to come up with a theory about why this might be. Did Klentak feel smart about signing guys with two first names because it feels like getting two players for the price of one? Does filling the roster with these two first namers, especially in the bullpen, make it harder to keep track of everyone and therefore harder to get mad at them for not being very good? (""Who blew that lead last night, was it Parker?"" ""No, I think it was Nick."" ""Wait, isn't that the same guy?"" ""No, it's Nick Vincent and Adam Parker."" ""I don't think that's right...who's the one that sprints in from the bullpen?"" ""I never remember, I look away from the screen whenever he comes in."")

Anyway, this became something of an inside joke between the two of us, me texting him whenever I thought of another guy (""Does Roman Quinn count? Hitting coach Joe Dillon? *Is this why they pursued Harper over Machado=*""), but Klentak's tenure was over at the end of the season so I didn't really pursue it much further, content to look forward to a new era of Phillies baseball.

One year later, the sport found itself facing the lockout.

So, with absolutely nothing going on in the baseball world in the depths of last winter, I happened upon a tweet asking people to name a sports conspiracy theory that they actually believe in, and decided that, with no baseball news to read, it was time to thoroughly and conclusively test my Matt-Klentak-likes-two-first-name-guys theory. What I thought would be a quick, silly project turned into a winter-long endeavor that only got more an more interesting the deeper I dove. I decided I had done too much work not to share my results with my fellow Philadelphians, so I started preparing to post my results in March of 2022right the lockout ended. Suddenly, we signed Schwarber and Castellanos, the season was starting, and immediately it seemed that nothing could be LESS important than Matt Klentak conspiracy theory content. I remained ready to share my results in the event of another collapse and inevitable ""how did this all go wrong"" soul search in 2022, and to my great delight, the post-Girardi Phillies spent the whole season being more interesting and exciting then my comically large spreadsheet could ever be.

However, I still feel I must share my results, so now, updated with 2022 stats, in the post-major-transactions-but-pre-pitchers-and-catchers-reporting lull in baseball content, I present you all my comprehensive analysis of the last 16 years of Major League Baseball, based only on how many two-first-name-players each team had.

# Results

**Klentak-led Phillies teams had more two-first-name (2FN) players than league average and than other recent Phillies teams**

My first task was to quantitatively assess my initial anecdotal finding that the Phillies in the Klentak era had more 2FN players than other teams. To do this, I downloaded all individual player seasons, minimum 0 PA or 0.0 IP, from 2007-2021 (I started with a smaller set of years and later expanded, see Materials and Methods for more details). Stats were split by team and by year, so if a player played for more than one team in a given season (e.g. was traded, cut and re-signed, etc.), he was counted as a member of both teams for that season.

Once I had the name of every player, I extracted every surname and sorted them based on whether they are also first names. This was the most subjective part of the analysis, but I tried to be as objective as possible (see Methods section for more details and Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of names). Worried about the subjectivity of choosing first names, I made two lists, a more restrictive set of first names and a more permissive set of ""borderline"" first names. I did all subsequent calculations using both the stricter set of first names as well as the more lenient set of borderline names to assess how sensitive my results are to the stringency of first name classification.

By tallying every 2FN player on each team in every season since 2007, as well as the total number of players who appeared on each team's roster, I calculated both the total number of 2FN players (#2FN) as well as the normalized percentage of each roster made up by 2FN players (2FN+) and compared these values across all teams in the league as well as across seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

[Table 1: Number of 2 first name players \(#2FN\) on all 30 MLB teams, 20072022. In this and all subsequent tables, red shading refers to an above league average value, while blue shading refers to a below average league value. Bold vertical lines show a change in GM\/President of Baseball Operations for a team, the bold box refers to Matt Klentak's tenure as Phillies GM, dashed horizontal lines show Klentak's tenure in other front offices, and the irregular dashed horizontal lines show the Phillies' playoff run of 2007-11. Team totals may not add up to the league total due to players that change teams mid-season and are thus counted separately for each team he played on.](https://preview.redd.it/xl703xn2k9ga1.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d65928bc259646d9389a66fe5f395e5f18a9f02c)

[Table 2: Normalized percentage of 2FN players on all 30 MLB teams, 20072022 \(2FN+, see Materials and Methods, Eq. 2\). A 2FN+ of 100 is league average for each given season.](https://preview.redd.it/l2lg34mlk9ga1.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5007da123a3a34d523ef13b0b0fb263f96f05185)

This quantification supported my anecdotal observation that the Klentak Era Phillies (the bolded boxes in each table) had a disproportionate number of 2FN playersthe Phillies #2FN (Table 1) and 2FN+ (Table 2) were both above league average during all 5 years of Klentak's tenure. The phenomenon also seems to be specific to Klentakboth values increased significantly during the first year of Klentak's tenure and dropped after he was replaced by Dave Dombrowski. These findings remain true when using the more permissive 2FNb list (adding ""b"" to any 2FN stat name indicates it was calculated using the borderline first names in addition to the 2FN names).

This continuous streak of 2FN-laden teams is not only unique in the recent history of the Phillies, but also in the league more broadly. Though some teams have had 5 year stretches of continuously above average #2FN and/or 2FN+, Matt Klentak is the only GM with to have an above average #2FN **and** 2FN+ in every season of his tenure (minimum three years). Thus, I concluded that I was not crazy in thinking that Matt Klentak's Phillies did have an especially large number of 2FN players, especially during 2020, which was both the year that I came up with this theory as well as the year that the Phillies led all of MLB in 2FN+.

Feeling vindicated, I found myself asking a new, perhaps more interesting questionwhy did Matt Klentak favor 2FN players?

**2FN+ is not correlated with success in the regular season or the playoffs**

The most generous hypothesis for why Klentak might favor 2FN players is that 2FN players might be correlated with team success. For example, one observation that can be made from Table 2 is that the Phillies have had a slightly above average 2FN+ not only for Klentak's tenure but also for most of their recent historyincluding during the 20072011 run of division titles. Could Klentak's 2FN fever be an attempt to mimic the 20072011 Phillies and their above average 2FN+?

Plotting regular season winning percentage (WPCT) and playoff results against 2FN+ clearly shows that there is no league-wide correlation between 2FN+ and success in either the regular season or the postseason (Figs. 1 and 2).

[Figure 1: WPCT vs. 2FN+ for all team seasons, 20072022, along with linear regressions for the whole league \(grey line\) and different Phillies eras of the past 16 years \(colored lines\). Based on R-squared values, there is no strong correlation between WPCT and 2FN+, league-wide or in any Phillies era, though the closest thing to a correlation seen in any Phillies era is in the 9 years prior to Klentak's hiring \(maroon\). This, however, is due almost entirely to the 2015 season, which was both the worst Phillies season by WPCT and the lowest season by 2FN+. The successful Phillies teams of 200711 saw at best no correlation between 2FN+ and WPCT.](https://preview.redd.it/7m24la2kl9ga1.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=560fa8c3295492c09c59b70df003406d9b45a30e)

[Figure 2: Playoff results vs. 2FN+ for all team seasons, 20072022. Playoff results were encoded as follows: 0 = missed playoffs, 0.5 = lost in WC round, 1 = lost in DS round, 2 = lost in CS round, 3 = lost in WS, and 5 = won WS. Once again, based on R-squared values, there are no strong correlations between 2FN+ and playoff result, but once again the particularly low 2FN+ season of 2015 gives the appearance of a positive correlation in the pre-Klentak era \(maroon\). Two of the three most successful Phillies teams \(2008, won WS; 2022, lost in WS\) had lower 2FN+ scores than most Phillies teams of the past 16 years, giving the appearance of a negative correlation between playoff results and 2FN+ for the '07'11 Phillies and the overall '07'22 Phillies, but by R-squared these correlations are not statistically significant.](https://preview.redd.it/8zg1a80pl9ga1.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bf5efb36bcf22b6ca63c72786aa7058fd2f93d0)

Figure 1 makes it clear that there is absolutely no correlation between 2FN+ and WPCT across the whole league (Figure 1, grey). However, at the time of Matt Klentak's hiring, there was an apparent (but statistically insignificant) correlation between 2FN+ and WPCT for the Phillies teams of the previous 9 seasons (Fig. 1, maroon). The though the relationship between playoff results and 2FN+ were more mixed during that time (Fig. 2, powder blue and maroon), since in the pre-Klentak era most of the playoff teams had a higher 2FN+ than the non-playoff teams but the most successful playoff team (2008) had a lower 2FN+ than most of the other playoff teams from the same era.

However, any illusion there might have been that a higher 2FN+ leads to higher WPCT for the Phillies was shattered by Klentak's subsequent five seasons, in which the Phillies had their 5 highest 2FN+ seasons coincide with 5 dreadful-to-middling-at-best seasons by WPCT. The overall effect of the Klentak years was to drag the Phillies' WPCT vs. 2FN+ regression to almost exactly in line with the league average, such that the red line, representing all Phillies seasons from 20072022, almost exactly matches the league-wide grey line.

**Klentak's obsession with 2FN players may have been an attempt to find the next Ryan Howard and Cliff Lee**

While the evidence that 2FN+ might be correlated with team success was mixed at best, it occurred to me that perhaps just considering the raw number of 2FN players on a team was not the right way to think about the construction of a 2FN playerbased roster. Thinking about the slightly above average 2FN+ of the playoff era Phillies, I don't think about them having lots of guys with two first namesbut I *do* think of them as having two star players who had two first namesRyan Howard and Cliff Lee. Is a team with a couple Nick Vincents and Tommy Hunters pitching a dozen or so middle relief innings the same as a team with an everyday-playing slugger like Ryan Howard or a complete-game-throwing ace like Cliff Lee? Of course not. So next I set out to quantify the differences in contributions by 2FN players to their teams.

To do this I defined yet another statistic, this one called weighted 2FN+, or w2FN+. w2FN+ looks at the total amount of playing time (i.e. plate appearances for batters and total batters faced for pitchers) in a given season and then calculates what percentage of a team's season-long PA+TBF that are contributed by a 2FN player. As with 2FN+, the values are then normalized so that 100 is league average. The results of this calculation are presented in Table 3.

[Table 3: Normalized percentage of playing time attributed to 2FN players \(w2FN+, see Materials and Methods, Eq. 4\) on each team, 20072022. A w2FN+ of 100 is league average in each season.](https://preview.redd.it/3tnicc7tk9ga1.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f027d3a9371f80648f3ae9d9983d87091fa7c626)

Although this new statistic, w2FN+, is still uncorrelated with team success (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2), comparing Tables 2 and 3 does reveal some interesting differences between the 20072011 Phillies and the Klentak Era Phillies. The 2007-2011 Phillies teams' w2FN+ values are equal to or greater than their 2FN+ for all five years, indicating that their 2FN players accounted for a larger share of the team's playing time than the percentage roster space they took up (i.e. they were regulars players, not minor contributors). Furthermore, you can see that the Phillies had the highest w2FN+ in the league in 2011, the same year that they had the best record in the league.

Conversely, the 2015 Phillies had a below average w2FN+ for the first time in at least 9 years, and this was also the year that 1) they were the worst team in the league 2) they decided to replace Ruben Amaro Jr. with Matt Klentak. If you were hired after the 2015 season and were looking very naïvely at the last great Phillies team vs. the current bad Phillies team, you might conclude that all your team needs to succeed is just one or two superstar 2FN players to lead you to victory, like Ryan Howard and Cliff Lee in 2011. (Of course, you would have to ignore the three intervening years during which the team continued to rank among the tops in the league in w2FN+ even as their WPCT continuously fell, but I did say this would be a very naïve way to look at the team.)

With this in mind, I came up with a new hypothesis, which was not that Klentak simply loves 2FN players, but perhaps he was trying to find the next Ryan Howard and Cliff Lee and, failing to do so, just kept adding more 2FN players trying to find them until he had packed the team with a large number of 2FN guys who didn't end up contributing much in terms of playing time. This difference between the playoff era Phillies and the Klentak era can be seen more clearly in Figure 3.

[Figure 3: Percentage of plate appearances contributed by individual 2FN Phillies from 20072022. Each individual 2FN player is represented by a separate color, with the width of the color bar representing that player's percentage of playing time for a given year. All non-2FN players are combined into the light grey section. Note that since non-2FN players represent 7090&amp;#37; of playing time in these years, the y-axis only goes to 30&amp;#37; in order to be able to see the 2FN players who contributed small amounts of playing time. Because of the difficulty of identifying 27 colors with good enough contrast to be distinguishable from each other, some colors are reused for non-overlapping players on the left and right sides of the chart \(red for Cliff Lee and Bryce Harper, powder blue for Ryan Howard and Jay Bruce, peach for Kyle Kendrick and Blake Parker, dark grey for Ben Francisco and Tommy Hunter, black for Juan Pierre and Archie Bradley, white for Tom Gordon and Nick Nelson, and gold for Ethan Martin and Spencer Howard\).](https://preview.redd.it/w327eqh0l9ga1.png?width=2004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d4d9b889afa9aa71e4600163bd924dfd3daa66f)

While Tables 2 and 3 show that both the Playoff Era Phillies and the Klentak Era Phillies were above league average in one way or another regarding their 2FN makeup (i.e. above average in 2FN+ or w2FN+ but not necessarily both), Figure 3 shows the difference in the shape of their rosters. The Playoff Era Phillies did not necessarily have a large number of 2FN players (represented as different colors in the graph), but most of the 2FN players they did have were regulars who contributed to a relatively large share of Phillies playing time (represented by the height of the color in the graph)led mostly by Ryan Howard, Cliff Lee, and Kyle Kendrick.

In contrast, the Klentak Era Phillies have a large number of 2FN players, most of whom contribute very little playing time. In support of the hypothesis that Klentak continued adding 2FN players in the hopes of finding a Howard or Lee, one can see that as his 2FN players generally faltered (i.e. contributed little playing time due primarily to ineffectiveness), more and more 2FN players are added, with at least one new 2FN player added during every year of the Klentak Era.

Though this approach clearly did not lead to the on-field success, one could argue that Klentak's search of the next Howard or Lee was successful in that it brought Bryce Harper to the Phillies. Harper was the first (and only) Klentak 2FN acquisition who contributed any meaningful amount of playing time or accrued any appreciable level of success. Of course, signing Manny Machado that offseason could just have easily led to a similar amount of success without having had to search so obsessively among the bargain bin of 2FN players. But, credit where credit is dueKlentak did successfully find one good 2FN player.

# Discussion

My research clearly supports my original hypothesis that Matt Klentak's Phillies were composed of a disproportionate number of 2FN players, and presents a case for why he may have pursued such a strategya naïve attempt to recreate the last great Phillies team, which was partially built upon the backs of two great 2FN players, Ryan Howard and Cliff Lee. These conclusions were drawn using the narrower, more restrictive set of first names of the two lists I generated. The general trends I found hold true when using the more permissive set of borderline first names, but the use of the larger list also leads to several other hypotheses, outlined below.

While Matt Klentak is the only GM with an above average #2FN and 2FN+ in every season of his tenure with a single team (minimum three years), looking at #2FNb and 2FNb+ (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) yields a few more executives who may have pro-2FN preferences. Most notably, Andy MacPhail's Orioles had an above average #2FNb and 2FNb+ for his entire 200811 tenure. Klentak worked for MacPhail's Orioles during that time and, of course, was later hired as Phillies GM by MacPhail as well. It is thus possible that MacPhail taught Klentak his 2FN-favoring ways, but the data analyzed do not go far enough back to determine whether MacPhail was a pro-2FN GM for his whole career or just coincidentally during his Orioles years. Thus we cannot say for certain whether it is MacPhail's or Klentak's presence in the front office that were causal for those teams' #2FNb and 2FNb+. However, based on MacPhail's press conferences during his Phillies tenure, it seems almost certain that he was completely uninvolved in roster decisions for the Phillies, so any impact he had on the Phillies 2FN+ would *at most* be attributed to what he may have taught Klentak when they were both with the Orioles.

The only other executives with fully above average 2FN\[b\]+ tenures (minimum three years) were Matt Byrnes ('07'10 Diamondbacks), Alex Anthopoulos ('18'22 Braves), and Ben Cherington ('12'15 Red Sox and '20'22 Pirates). However, of these three GMs, two have had a below average 2FN+ when leading other teams (Byrnes' '12'14 Padres and Anthopoulos' '10'15 Blue Jays).

Thus, whether looking at 2FN+ or 2FNb+, there are no more than two executives who have a consistently above average 2FN\[b\]+ for their whole careersMatt Klentak and Ben Cherington. And since this entire analysis has been an exercise in drawing questionable conclusions from meaningless metrics that probably represent nothing more than statistical noise, allow me to see if I can take that connection and use the course of Ben Cherington's career to make a prediction about how the Phillies will do in the post-Klentak era:

Ben Cherington ('12'15 Red Sox) and Matt Klentak ('16'20 Phillies) each led one of the oldest franchises in the MLB. Both franchises were well acquainted with failure throughout their histories, but had each had a recent taste of success, both having had broken long World Series droughts in the previous 10 years. Both of these GMs led their teams to an above average 2FN\[b\]+ in every year of their respective tenures. Both of these GMs led their teams to a below .500 WPCT in all but one year of their respective tenures. Both of these GMs were fired and replaced by Dave Dombrowski. Both of these franchises lost a playoff series to the Houston Astros in Dave Dombrowski's second year after taking over. The Red Sox won the World Series in the third year after Dave Dombrowski took over for Ben Cherington. 2023 will be the third year after Dave Dombrowski took over for Matt Klentak.

I set out to determine if the Klentak Era Phillies had a disproportionate number of 2FN players and, if so, why Kletak may have engaged in such an inane strategy. In the course of my analysis, I have strayed from my initial hypothesis and come to a new conclusion:

The Phillies are gonna win the 2023 World Series.

Materials and Methods

**Determination of last names that are considered first names for this analysis**

All individual player seasons, team split, min. 0 PA (hitters) and min. 0.0 IP (pitchers) were downloaded from FanGraphs, originally for the 20152021 seasons, then, after I had my first name decision system down, I expanded to the 20072014 seasons, and then the 2022 season after it concluded. These data were loaded (regrettably, in retrospect) to MS Excel. I originally wrote a function to compare each players last name to a list of first names I manually curated by scrolling through the list of all the players names, but decided quickly that looking at the players names in their team context could bias me toward inclusion of Phillies and exclusion of non-Phillies to prove my hypothesis. Instead, I wrote a function to separate the last names from the rest of the name (including removing any suffixes like Jr.) and then looking at that list of last names to decide which would count as first names. The same process was followed for what Im calling borderline first names. The names in both lists can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Outside of the most obvious first names (Adam, Joe, John, etc.), I used the following principles for choosing names and borderline names:

1. Is the name on a list of 100 most popular baby boy names in America in the 80s or 90s (the majority of players in the years analyzed were from America in the 80s or 90s)?
2. For names that are common as both first and last names, does the disambiguation page on Wikipedia for the name have significantly more pages for people with that name as a first name or last name? (This was used for some names that are more common outside the United States and for which I thus had less of a gut feeling for how common or uncommon the name was as a first name)
3. As a tiebreaker in close cases, can I think of a baseball player right off the top of my head with the name as a first name? The thinking behind this was that for rarer names, a baseball fan might be more likely to think of a name as a first name if they associate it with a baseball player. For example, Jameson was included as a first name because the first Jameson I think of is Jameson Taillon.
4. In general, I aimed to include homophones of first names, not homonyms, and so spelling differences between a last name and a first name were not disqualifying (e.g. Brice and Curtiss were included). In the cases of names with multiple common pronunciations, or where I did not know the pronunciation, I erred on the side of including names whose spelling could allow them to be pronounced like a first name. Managers were not included in this analysis, but, as an example, Charlie Manuel would have been included as a 2FN guy because though his name is pronounced like car *manual*, it is spelled the same as the Spanish first name Manuel, e.g. Manuel Margot. (I wish I had included managers in the analysisthe inclusion of Charlie Manuel as a 2FN guy would have only strengthened my argument that Klentak's 2FN obsession came from the presence of prominent 2FN guys on the 20072011 Phillies)
5. Borderline names were composed primarily of old-timey or otherwise rare names (e.g. Cecil, Fletcher, Solomon), names that sounded like first names but differed by one letter (e.g. Bryan**t**, Michael**s**, \*\*O'\*\*Connor), names that are more common among women than men, and names that otherwise just barely failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the first name list.  

   1. A distinction was drawn between names that are one letter different rather than one syllable different than first names primarily to exclude the relatively common ""-son"" names. Since my initial hypothesis was that Klentak was trying to overwhelm us with so many first names in the bullpen that we can't keep all the separate guys straight in our head, I thought names should be included that sound enough like first names that you might mis-hear it as a first name, and to me, the place to draw that line seemed to be between names like ""Roberts"" and those like ""Robertson.""
   2. Similarly, the reason to exclude women's names from the primary list was primarily tied to this hypothesis about trying to confuse fans about the number of people in the bullpen. As much as I hate reinforce the gender binary and/or the patriarchy, I reasoned that the average baseball fan in 2021 would be unlikely to mistake Kelly or Grace as the first name of a member of a major league bullpen.

**Determination of when MLB teams' changed roster-deciding front office members**

This was harder than I thought. Teams have different front office structures, with GMs, Presidents of Baseball Operations, and sometimes other positions as well. Several teams also created new positions during the years 200722. Despite the rest of this post as evidence to the contrary, I did not have the time to determine who was primarily responsible for roster decisions for all 30 teams for all 16 years, especially for those who restructured their front offices sometime during the middle of the time period analyzed, so I did my best to determine who was the primary player acquisition executive for each team during each year, mostly using the Wikipedia lists of teams' GMs and Presidents of Baseball Operations, but occasionally relying on news stories to clarify who had primary player-signing authority in a given year. And if you're a fan of another team who knows better than I do feel free to correct me, I'm sure there are at least some inaccuracies here. In the case where a GM (or equivalent) was fired/replaced mid-season, I attributed the team's 2FN stats to the new executive starting the next full season. As such, the bold lines in Tables 13 and Supplemental Tables 12 represent the first full season of a new executive's tenure.

His contribution to the 2FN composition of non-Phillies rosters during this time are uncertain, as he held non-GM roles for each non-Phillies team he worked for \(BAL 2008-2011, LAA 2012-2015, MIL 2022\), but it does seem his 2FN obsession is not as consistent across all teams and years as during his Phillies years.](https://preview.redd.it/7z94jcksl9ga1.png?width=2002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db0b25e394e1569e4c53e7bc8d14dbd378fc2f7b)","baseball",114,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10tw6ls/i_had_a_theory_that_former_phillies_gm_matt/"

It is a truly remarkable turnabout by the Mariners.   From the beginning of the season to the end of June, the Mariners basically lived within 3 games of .500.    The pitching staff regressed in terms of both health and performance.   The offense looked lifeless.   The opportunities that were presented were usually squandered and basically everyone on the lineup was underperforming.

After grand expectations for the M's to step up, this level of mediocrity was shocking.   It was like nothing had changed with this team, despite making the playoffs last season.    Seattle entered July having dug themselves into a massive hole.     

Seattle stood on the precipice of their event horizon.   Straddling over the edge of a potentially lost season.  If they wanted ANY chance to salvage their season, they had to play basically perfect.    

And as it turns out, that's just what they've done over the past month and change: Play basically perfect.  

In the 1995 Season, the Seattle Mariners adopted a mantra in their quest for their first playoff berth: *Refuse to Lose*   In the time since, the Seattle Mariners have called on the powers of ""Refusing to Lose"" to go on these torrid hot streaks.   When the fate of their season hangs in the balance, they become white hot.

In 2021, the Seattle Mariners went on 10-1 to end the month of September to keep their playoffs hopes alive into October

In 2022, the Seattle Mariners stood at 10 games under .500.   Their season looked dead in the water, they were being declared dead by Jomboy (it was Plouffe, not Jomboy).   But after that declaration, the M's went 22-3 from the end of June into the All-Star break.    Keeping their season alive.    Eventually culminating in them ending their two decade long playoff drought

In the 2023 Season, the Seattle Mariners were basically dead to rights, stuck behind a lot of great teams.   They've gone 24-10 so far, to bring themselves right back into it, a game and a half out of a Wild Card spot and just below 6 games out of the division.        

What's going to happen?   I can't really say.    That's the beauty of Chaos Ball, baby.","baseball",189,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15o4qxy/on_june_30th_the_seattle_mariners_were_3842_and/"

On October 6th, 1995 at 11:44 PM EDT, Jeff Brantley induced a fly ball by Mike Piazza to Reds centerfielder Darren Lewis to complete a sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. Little did anyone know that this victory at Riverfront Stadium would be the last taste of postseason success for Cincinnati and also be the last postseason victory for the Reds in their hometown for 27 years.

The Reds went on to be swept by the Atlanta Braves in the 1995 National League Championship Series and would go on to only have 7 winning seasons over the next 27 years.

Reds postseason stories since then include being [no-hit by Roy Halladay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ju2p-UrBkc) in their first postseason game since the 1995 NLCS, only the 2nd no-hitter in postseason history. Then their next appearance allowed the Reds to become the only team to ever lose three straight potential series clinching games at home in a [loss to the Giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIjYlNdfiec). The very next year, the Reds made a Wild Card Game against the Pirates, with a memorable moment of [Johnny Cueto dropping a ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcLUw3_oN1g), and the Pirates only postseason advancement since 1979. The only other postseason appearance since then was during the Wild Card Round in the expanded 2020 playoffs which feature the Reds becoming the first team to not score a run in a postseason series.
