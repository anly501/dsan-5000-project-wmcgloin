"2023-03-29",1680105966,"15 Reasons Why MLB Opening Day is the best day in all of sports, in honor of tomorrow's 15 games.","**1) Every fanbase has a new hope and optimism**

It doesn't matter if your team only won 75 games and is expected to be among the worst in the league this year, or whether your team threatened to break the record for most wins in a season before nosediving hard in September - it's a new year and baseball is back. Anything can happen as the new season plays out.

**2) Spring has officially sprung**

Spring is all about rebirth - just ask Jesus. And what better way to celebrate rebirth than by resurrecting a new season of baseball? Move over snow - BASEBALL IS BACK.

**3) Nearly every team starts their ace on Opening Day**

Unlike other sports, baseball doesn't ease into it by letting some scrub on the mound on opening day. Nearly every team is starting their best pitcher and you will see the greatest being great all day long. Can Max Fried get 27 Ks against the Nats? Probably.

**4) Every Team Plays**

Unlike pretty much every other sport, which has staggered start dates for various teams, every single team plays on Opening Day. That means that we get a look at all 30 organizations and can begin drawing conclusions based off a sample size that any scientist would disregard. But we're baseball fans, not scientists. So, feel free to craft overarching narratives about the season based off the Opening Day results.

**5) There's no heartbreak on Opening Day**

Even if your team loses badly, there's still 161 games to go. That's like... less than 2% of all the games.

**6) It comes at the perfect time**

March Madness is basically over. Nobody cares about regular season NBA. The sports world needs games, and Major League Baseball delivers.

**7) It's a day without sadness or tears**

There's an old saying *""There's no crying in baseball""*. This is normally a statement that crying is forbidden. However, it takes a different meaning on Opening Day - crying isn't forbidden, it's impossible. You **cannot** cry on Opening Day. It can't be done. It's a day where nothing bad ever happens.

* *Disclaimer* - A single tear is permitted if your team has a no-hitter get broken up in the 9th inning.

**H) It's too cold and wet for Zach Hample to steal your Home Run Ball**

Since it's not hot out enough yet for the good hitting conditions, you're much less likely to catch a Home Run ball which is then stolen by the biggest menace baseball has ever seen.

**9) Ballpark Hot Dogs jut hit different on Opening Day.**

The sweetest taste you will ever taste is a hot dog on Opening Day. It's as American as baseball. And the fact that you've been anticipating this hot dog every day for the past 6 months makes it extra special.

**10) Opening Day is the 0-0 Count of baseball.**

Some people say ""Live life like it's a 3-2 count"". That's stupid. Why would you want to live your life knowing you might have to walk all the time? Get a freaking driver's license, loser. A 0-0 Count is a fresh slate. Anything can happen - maybe even a walk. 3-2 counts are overrated.

**11) Rob Manfred can't change the rules anymore.**

The season has started - the rules are set. The bad man can't hurt us anymore.

**12) When there *are* homeruns on Opening Day, they set the tone for the season.**

If you homer in your first game, you are on pace for a 162-dinger season. Can't argue with math. Move over Barry.

**13) MLB Opening Day has a long and proud history**

Since the American League and National League joined in 1903 to form Major League Baseball, there has been an annual tradition - the first gameday of every year is always MLB Opening Day. This will mark the 120th year of this historic streak.

**14) MLB Opening Day is an Internationally-Celebrated Day**

Baseball is a sport that appeals to people beyond just America. This is evidenced by the fact that the Toronto Blue Jays play their home games in Toronto, Ontario, which is in Canada. This makes baseball an international sport.

**15) BASEBALL IS BACK BABY**

The last reason that MLB Opening Day is the best day in sports is that it means baseball is back, and baseball is the best sport. Checkmate, soccer fans.","baseball",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/125sgoc/15_reasons_why_mlb_opening_day_is_the_best_day_in/"

"2023-08-20",1692552421,"Ya Gotta Believe 2023 or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Huff the Copium","Make no bones about it. The 2023 Mets have fucking sucked to watch. From top to bottom, from rotation to bullpen to lineup to coaching, it has been a miserable season for all of us Mets fans.

But with the team on a sudden hot streak, the offense clicking, the pitching suddenly tightening up their game ever so slightly - we see smiles in the dugout and better attitudes in the clubhouse, a little more pep from Buck, guys having fun for the first time in a while.

Let's look at this morning's NL Wild Card standings:

|**Team**|**W**|**L**|**PCT**|**WCGB**|**L10**|**STRK**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|*Philadelphia*|*67*|*56*|*.545*|*+3.5*|*5-5*|*W1*|
|*San Francisco*|*64*|*59*|*.520*|*+0.5*|*2-8*|*L3*|
|*Chi Cubs*|*63*|*59*|*.516*|*0*|*5-5*|*W1*|
|Cincinnati|64|60|.516|0|5-5|L1|
|Arizona|64|61|.512|0.5|7-3|W2|
|Miami|64|61|.512|0.5|5-5|L2|
|San Diego|59|66|.472|5.5|4-6|L2|
|NY Mets|58|66|.468|6.0|6-4|W4|

The Mets are 6 games back from a wild card spot. Of all the teams in the running, only Arizona is ""hotter"" with a 7-3 L10 compared to the Mets' 6-4, and the Mets are on a 4-game winning streak compared to Arizona's 2-game streak.

By any measure, the 2023 Mets are the longest of long shots. They have a bad run differential, a roster of AAAA scrubs, young kids trying to scrape together their major league skills, and underperforming vets.

But what if the Mets can keep things going? Well... Look at who they play in mid to late September:

|Team|Date|
:--|:--|
|vs Arizona|9/11|
|vs Arizona|9/12|
|vs Arizona|9/13|
|vs Arizona|9/14|
|vs Cincinnati|9/15|
|vs Cincinnati|9/16|
|vs Cincinnati|9/17|
|@ Miami|9/18|
|@ Miami|9/19|
|@ Miami|9/20|
|@ Philly|9/21|
|@ Philly|9/22|
|@ Philly|9/23|
|@ Philly|9/24|
|vs Miami|9/26|
|vs Miami|9/27|
|vs Miami|9/28|
|vs Philly|9/29|
|vs Philly|9/30|
|vs Philly|10/1|

That's right - seven games vs Philly, six games vs Miami, four games vs Arizona, and three games vs Cincy. All teams that stand in their path to a wild card spot. The Mets have a rare opportunity to make a run and directly influence the standings in a big way. Believe it or not, they have a lot of control over their own destiny.

On August 19, 2016, the Mets were 60-62, and 5.5 games behind in the wild card. That team made the playoffs. They were buoyed by unexpected contributions by the unexpected 1-2 punch of Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman, midseason trade Kelly Johnson, the return of Mets legend Jose Reyes, the steady vet James Loney, and up-and-coming rookie Brandon Nimmo.

On July 29, 2019, the Mets were 50-55, and 6 games behind in the wild card. That team did *not* make the playoffs, but they finished 86-76 and 3 games back. They were not mathematically eliminated until the final week of the season. Their surge came at the hands of rookies Pete Alonso and Jeff McNeil, fan favorite Dom Smith, steady vet Joe Panik, and folk hero Luis Guillorme.

I pointed this out in 2019 in two separate threads [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NewYorkMets/comments/cjqxxu/august_19_2016_mets_are_6062_and_55_behind_in_the/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NewYorkMets/comments/ck7e5w/8192016_55_gb_in_the_wild_card_67_playoff_odds/). I felt hope in 2016, I felt hope in 2019, and I feel hope in 2023.

I know this sounds insane. I know I'm caffeinated up right now. But wouldn't it be special? Wouldn't it be special for this 2023 Mets team - a team everybody counted out after a disastrous June swoon - to make a wild card run? Even if the season ends on October 1, wouldn't it be special for these Mets to be playing meaningful September baseball? You and I both know what happens when dudes start to believe.

To all Mets fans reading this, sincerely: Ya Gotta Believe. Enjoy the rest of the ride. LGM.","baseball",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15whbxi/ya_gotta_believe_2023_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/"
"2023-04-18",1681837538,"Daily Rundown 4/17/23"," Angels (7-8) at Red Sox (8-8)  Final: Angels defeat Red Sox 5-4

In a game plagued with rain delays, we only got to see Shohei Ohtani for 2 innings on the mound in which he gave up a run. However, the Angels put up runs in the first two frames with a Hunter Renfoe 3-run homerun and Brandon Drury sac fly in the first followed by a Renfroe RBI ground out in the second. The Red sox tried to match the halos with a run of their own with a Rob Refsnyder RBI groundout but that was all they could muster until the 6th as Tucker Davidson provided solid fill-in innings, going 3.1 innings and allowing 1 run. On Bostons end, Kutter Crawford picked up the slack after Bryan Bello only went 2.2 innings. Crawford put up 6.1 shutout innings, only allowing 1 hit. The Red Sox tacked on two in the 6th and one more in the 9th, but Carlos Estevez was able to close the game with the save. 

Angels POTG: Hunter Renfroe - 1/4, R, 4 RBI, HR (4)

Red Sox POTG: Kutter Crawford - 6.1 IP, 1 H, 0R, 0 BB, 5K

&amp;#x200B;

Rays (14-3) at Reds (7-9)  Final: Reds defeat Rays 8-1

Reds fans must have mixed feelings about this game. For starters, they beat the best team in baseball by a nice margin, being powered by Kevin Newman who went 3/4 with his second long ball of the year and TJ Friedl who racked up 4 RBIs, 3 of which came on a bases clearing double in the 4th. However, Cincy faithful had to see their young star Hunter Greene leave the game after being hit with a Yandy Diaz comebacker after finishing 3 innings. Buck Farmer, Alex Young, Ian Gibaut, and Kevin Herget all provided solid innings to fill in for Greene. Josh Lowe took Herget deep in the 9th to score the Rays lone run. 

Reds POTG: Kevin Newman - 3/4, 2 R, 2 RBI, 2B, HR (2)  

Rays POTG: Josh Lowe - 2/4, R, RBI, HR (4) 

&amp;#x200B;

Giants (5-10) at Marlins (9-8) 

Despite the Giants jumping out to a quick lead, scoring a run in the 2nd on a Heliot Ramos double and 2 in the 3rd with another double from David Villar, Logan Webb would go on to surrender 4 unanswered runs before getting out of the 7th inning, highlighted by a pinch-hit 2- run blast by Jorge Soler with two outs in the 7th, knocking Webb out. Jesus Luzardo struggled, giving up 6 hits and 3 runs in only 4.1. The Marlin bullpen was able to stifle the Giants bats however, giving up only one hit once Luzardo was relieved. AJ Puk picked up a save, and Jazz Chisholm and Luis Arraez hit RBI singles in the 3rd and 6th respectively.

Marlins POTG:  Jorge Soler - 1/1, R, 2 RBI, HR (5)

Giants POTG: Wilmer Flores - 3/4, R

&amp;#x200B;

Rangers (10-6) at Royals (4-13)  Final: Rangers defeat Royals 4-0

The Royals, like the rest of the world, could not hit Jacob deGrom. However, the Rangers ace had to leave after 4 hitless innings with a sore right wrist. Dane Dunning then came in and was just as effective, tallying 5 Ks in 4.1 innings, surrendering the one and only hit on the day for the Royals. Jordan Lyles did what he does best and ate innings, going 8 while allowing 2 earned runs on a Josh Jung 3-run bomb in the 1st and a Marcus Semien solo shot in the 3rd. With only 5 hits in the entire game, not much excitement here. 

Rangers POTG: Dane Dunning - 4.1 IP, 5 K, 1 H, 0 R, W  

Royals POTG: Jordan Lyles - 8 IP, 3 H, 2 ER, 3 K

&amp;#x200B;

Diamondbacks (10-7) at Cardinals (7-10)  Final: Diamondbacks defeat Cardinals 6-3

The Diamondbacks go up 2-0 on the series to the Cardinals, carried by Pavin Smiths grand slam in the 7th inning. Ketel Marte also homered in the 7th after he drove in a run with a single in the first as well. Merrill Kelly threw 6 innings of one-run ball, getting 3 strikeouts as well. Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty got the loss and dropped to 1-2 as he gave up 4 earned in 6 innings. The Cardinal runs were driven in by a Wilson Contreras double in the 6th and Alec Burleson 2-run homer in the 8th. Andrew Chafin closed the game for his 3rd save on the year. 

Diamondbacks POTG: Marrill Kelly - 6 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 3 K, W

Cardinals POTG: Alec Burleson - 1/4, R, 2 RBI, HR (2) 

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Jays (10-7) at Astros (8-9)  Final: Astros defeat Blue Jays 9-2

After Cristian Javier had a 1-2-3 top of the first, Kevin Gausman was not as lucky in the bottom half, giving up 7 runs before getting the first 3 outs. The 1st featured a 2-RBI double from new acquisition Jose Abreu, another 2-RBI double from rookie Corey Julks, and a 3-run homer from Jake Meyers. Matt Chapman kept up his hot hitting with a round-tripper in the 2nd, but the Jays would only be able to add one more on a Santiago Espinal homer in the 8th. Javier went a solid 5 innings, and Phil Maton followed him up with 2 shut down innings with 4 Ks. The Stros added another in the 3rd with a Julks homer and one in the 6th on Mauricio Dubons sac fly. 

Astros POTG: Corey Julks - 2/4, 2 R, 3 RBI, HR (2), 2B

Blue Jays POTG: Santiago Espinal - 1/1, R, RBI, HR (1) 

&amp;#x200B;

Pirates (10-7) at Rockies (5-12)  Final: Pirates defeat Rockies 14-3

The Pirates offense went off in this contests, tallying 16 hits and 14 runs, 9 of which came against Kyle Freeland. KeBryan Hayes and Carlos Santana had 3 RBIs each while Andrew McCutchen and Jack Suwinski both hit solo home runs. Hayes also provided his usual stellar defense as well. Mark Mathias collected 4 hits and an RBI of his own on top of starting a magnificent double play. Rich Hill earned his first win as a Pirate going 6 strong, only allowing one run on a Kris Bryant long ball. The Pirates continue their surprising success in a full on Coors game. 

Pirates POTG: Mark Mathias - 4/5, 2 R, RBI

Rockies POTG: Kris Bryant - 3/4, 2 R, RBI, HR (2), 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Cubs (9-6) at As (3-14)  Final: Cubs defeat As 10-1

So far, it has been the week of Patrick Wisdom. Going 3 for 5, Wisdom clubbed his 7th and 8th big flies of the year, tying him with Pete Alonso for the MLB lead. The Cubs racked up an astounding 20 hits in Oakland, 5 of which coming from Cody Bellinger. Nico Hoerner, Dansby Swanson, Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki, and Yan Gomes all had multiple hits against As pitchers. Hayden Wesneski lowered his ERA on the year to 4.15, giving up nothing after a first inning jam which resulted in the only run for the As. Wesneski struck out 7 over his 7 innings of work. Not much positives on the As side however. 

Cubs POTG: Patrick Wisdom - 3/5, 2 R, 4 RBI, 2 HR (7,8)

As POTG: Esteury Ruiz - 2/4, R

&amp;#x200B;

Brewers (12-5) at Mariners (8-9)  Final: Brewers defeat Mariners 7-3

Similar to the Reds and Rangers wins, this game leaves Brewers fans with mixed feelings. After 5.1 innings, Corbin Burnes left the game grasping his chest. Despite this bad news, the Brewers offense were able to allow Burnes to get the win, scoring 3 in the 2nd off a Luke Voigt RBI double, Owen Miller RBI single, and Joey Weimer RBI fielders choice. Cal Raleigh responded in the bottom of the 2nd with a solo bomb. The Brewers tacked on 4 more through the course of the game highlighted by Brice Turangs 2nd career homer. Ty France doubled home a run and Julio Rodriguez homered to round out the Ms night on offense. 

Brewers POTG: Brian Anderson - 3/5, R, RBI

Mariners POTG: Cal Raleigh - 1/3, R, RBI, HR (2), BB

&amp;#x200B;

Braves (13-4) at Padres (8-10)  Final: Braves defeat Padres 2-0 

The only runs in the game came off the bat of Austin Riley as he launched a liner over the left field wall with Ronald Acuna on second. The Braves have now scored 17 runs in first innings, the most in MLB. On the other side, Max Fried made his first start since opening day and looked sharp. 4 hits and 4 Ks in 5 innings. Dylan Lee, Jesse Chavez, and AJ Minter all had quiet innings in relief as Minter grabbed the save. Ryan Weathers pitched well outside of the first, going 6 only allowing 2 runs with 5 Ks. 

Braves POTG: Ronald Acuna - 3/5, R, 2B

Padres POTG: Xander Bogaerts - 2/4

&amp;#x200B;

Mets (11-6) at Dodgers (8-9)  Final: Mets defeat Dodgers 8-6

Dustin May is one of the nastiest pitchers in the MLB, entering the game with the lowest BAA against in the league and a 1.47 ERA. However, he struggled in this start, giving up 5 earned in less than 6 innings. Daniel Vogelbach got him for a 2-run home run in the 2nd and the Mets put another 3 runs on his line in the 4th with RBIs from Jeff McNeil, Vogelbach again, and Brett Baty. The Dodgers' runs came primarily from the long ball: one from Freddie Freeman in the first, another from Freeman in the 5th, and the last from Max Muncy in the 6th to put the Dodgers up 6-5 at the time. The Mets were able to rally against Alex Vesia and Phil Bickford for 3 more runs in the 7th to put the score at its final of 8-6 as David Peterson got the win. 

Mets POTG: Daniel Vogelbach - 1/2, R, 3 RBI, HR (1)

Dodgers POTG: Freddie Freeman - 3/4, 2R, 3 RBI, 2 HR (2,3)

&amp;#x200B;

Game to watch: 

Rays at Reds:

The two starters in this game are two of the most promising young arms in the sport right now. Nick Lodolo for the Reds has cemented himself as one of the best strikeout artists in the game with 27 Ks over just 17 innings. Taj Bradley won his first career start for the Rays, fanning 8 over 5 innings with a lively fastball that averaged just under 96 MPH. The Rays have lost 3 of their last 4 after their historic 13-0 start, so they need to get back in the win column. The Reds offense however exploded on Rays pitching yesterday putting up 8 runs.","baseball",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12qwj6c/daily_rundown_41723/"
"2023-09-12",1694532144,"National League MVP race breakdown as of 9/12","I know it's been discussed to death but this is an amazing crop of outstanding individual seasons in the NL ( even cooler that it's 4 guys on 2 teams at the top) so wanted to do a deep dive on it mostly for my own entertainment.

**Tier 1:**

**bold** indicates best in category out of the 4 players

Ronald Acuña Jr:  .334/**.416**/.584 (1.000 OPS)  11.5% BB, **11.3% K**, .423 wOBA,  **.464 xWOBA**, 7.3 fWAR, 7.3 bWAR, 36 HR, **65 SB**, **131 R**, 95 RBI

Mookie Betts: .313/.411/.611 (**1.022 OPS**) 13.4% BB, 15.6% K, **.427 wOBA**, .416 xWOBA, **7.9 fWAR**, **8.1** **bWAR**, 39 HR, 11 SB, 119 R, 103 RBI

These guys are the unquestioned leaders right now and barring an insane Freddie or Olson stretch it seems pretty locked in that they will finish 1 and 2 in voting.

Ronald obviously has the historic 40/70 chase going on but there are other aspects to his season that are almost as impressive. His K rate has been cut more than half from last season ( which was already tied for a career best ) down to 11.3 % and is the only candidate here that is walking more than striking out. Statcast thinks he's by far the best hitter of the bunch and his .464 xWOBA thinks he's been getting extremely unlucky which is crazy to think about. Also his 131 runs are already tied with Dale Murphy for the modern day single season braves record. You would think he's the unanimous MVP right? well....

Mookie Betts has been unbelievable and will be a first ballot hall of famer when he hangs it up. WAR has him squarely in front as the most valuable player and his OPS is also tops in the league. His ability to move around the field and play adequate defense anywhere is ridiculously valuable and he's doing it while slashing .300/.400/.600 (!!) . Ridiculous season that would be a runaway MVP most other years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tier 2:**

Freddie Freeman: **.335**/.413/.570 (.983 OPS) 10.4% BB, 16.6% K, .412 wOBA, .410 xWOBA, 7.0 fWAR, 6.0 bWAR, 25 HR, 18 SB, 117 R, 91 RBI

Matt Olson: .279/.386/**.614** ( 1.000 OPS ) **14.4% BB**, 23.9 % K, .414 wOBA, .395 xWOBA, 5.8 fWAR, 6.2 bWAR, **50 HR**, 1 SB, 114 R, **127 RBI**

Freddie has continued to get better with age and he's been an elite hitter by any metric. Everybody knows about his hitting prowess but how about 18 bags?? and overall an elite baserunner who doesn't make any mistakes and consistently takes extra bases. Also note that he's pushing towards a 60 double season which is unheard of.

Matt Olson's right back in this tier with his latest hot streak which has pushed his OPS up to 1.000. He's going to break the Braves single season home run record and has been every bit as good of a hitter if not a better hitter overall than Freddie this year with his pop. 50 HR and 127 RBIs on 9/12 is insane.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to vote right now I'd probably go 1) Ronald 2) Mookie 3) Freddie 4) Olson but honestly 1/2 and 3/4 are both interchangeable.  I've seen a lot of bitterness from braves and dodgers fans which is crazy to me. Enjoy greatness!

|Chicago White Sox|Miami Marlins|10-8|They have also not met in the World Series. Longtime White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen went to the Marlins for the 2012 season, as the Marlins attempted to go all in for a season, which didn't work out so hot for them. They will play on the South Side Jun 9-11.|

|Detroit Tigers|Atlanta Braves|14-10|These two teams have not met in the World Series, despite both teams having several postseason appearances over their long histories. They will play in Detroit Jun 12-14.|
|Detroit Tigers|Miami Marlins|8-11|These teams met for the first ever interleague closing series, in 2013. This series had more significance, as the Marlins managed to notch a rare walk-off no-hitter against the Tigers in game 162, thrown by Henderson Alvarez. What looked liked a promising young career, at one point he just kinda disappeared. He last pitched with the Phillies in 2017, and with the Nationals AAA affiliate in 2019. Maybe he'll make a comeback someday. Anyway, these teams will once again meet in Miami Jul 28-30.|
|Detroit Tigers|New York Mets|13-11|These teams were close to meeting in a World Series in the 80s, with both teams making a couple postseason appearances but neither of them in the same season. They meet in Detroit May 2-4|
|Detroit Tigers|Philadelphia Phillies|12-10|These teams have also not met in the World Series. They play in Philly Jun 5-7.|
|Detroit Tigers|Washington Nationals|12-10|I remember a matchup between these two teams on May 11 2016 in D.C., when Jordan Zimmermann was starting for the Tigers, and Max Scherzer for the Nationals. Just two years prior, these starters were playing on opposite teams. They will play again this May, and again in D.C. from May 19-21.|
|Kansas City Royals|Atlanta Braves|9-11|For some reason it feels like there's some kind of historical significance here, but there really isn't. Jon Bois fans will know the Lonnie Smith connection, and therefore the John Schuerholz connection as well. These teams met Apr 14-16 in KC, with the Braves winning all three games.|
|Kansas City Royals|Miami Marlins|10-8|These two teams meet in Miami Jun 5-7, marking the third straight series these two teams have met in Florida. They will likely play in Kansas City next year, for the first time since 2013|
|Kansas City Royals|New York Mets|7-9|This was the first ever all expansion team World Series. We have since seen the Astros and Nationals in 2019, but I hope we see another all expansion team series this year. This also was the first ever Opening Day World Series rematch, as they met in Kansas City on Opening Day 2016, which is not something you could plan any better for the Royals. They will meet in Kansas City again Aug 1-3.|
|Kansas City Royals|Philadelphia Phillies|7-8|These teams met in the 1980 World Series, with both teams looking for their first ring. The Phillies took home the title, their first ever, and the last pre-expansion team to win one. The Royals would grab their first only 5 years later, in 1985. The Phils and Royals will meet in Philadelphia Aug 4-6.|
|Kansas City Royals|Washington Nationals|5-13|These two teams will meet from May 26-28 in Kansas City.|
|Minnesota Twins|Atlanta Braves|8-11|These teams met in the 1991 World Series, which is considered one of the best ever because of how close it was. Back to Lonnie Smith, his famous baserunning blunder allowed the Twins to walk it off in the bottom of the 10th inning, after Jack Morris threw 10 shutout innings, which a lot of people argue is the sole reason why he's in the Hall of Fame. I will use this space to argue that Dave Stieb is also a Hall of Famer. Twins vs Braves? Oh yeah, they meet in Atlanta Jun 26-28.|
|Minnesota Twins|Miami Marlins|10-9|The recent partners in the Pablo Lopez/Luis Arraez deal, they met in Miami as the Marlins took the series 2 games to 1.|

"2023-05-06",1683356293,"MLB 2023 Rookie Analysis #3","#  Rookie Performance Evaluation 3

With so many players in the MLB, some of the newest players get lost behind some of the high profile names. We are here today to evaluate every rookie who has played this year and highlight the top performances of the last two weeks and for the entire year. This week Masataka Yoshida shut up all the haters, Esterury Ruiz stole four bases in a single game, and Brett Baty has begun to slug his way to fans hearts in New York. (Mash Mervis also got his first hit and RBI).

# Top Weekly Performances

**American League:**

1. **Masataka Yoshida (AL) -** It took him a couple weeks, but no one has played better the last two weeks than the Japanese superstar. Yoshida has slashed .451/.491/.843 with 5 doubles and 5 home runs. Yoshida led all rookies the last two weeks with 23 hits. He is seeing all at the plate walking 13 times contrasted to striking out only 11 times this season. Yoshida is currently on a MLB leading 14 game hitting streak and has extended his slash line for the year to .310/.397/.550. Yoshida is in the 98% percentile on strikeout rate, 89% percentile in whiff rate, and 86% percentile in max exit velocity. Yoshida is hitting the ball often, taking his balls, and hitting them hard. The only thing Red Sox fans may want to see Yoshida improve in is his defense. Yoshida ranks in the bottom 10% in Outs above Average and Outfield Jump. Despite this, Yoshida only has one error on the season with a .974% fielding percentage. In the end, Red Sox fans should be happy with the production from their new right fielder. 
2. **Josh Jung (AL) -** In the last two weeks, Jung (and Toshida) lead all rookies in home runs with 5 and leads all rookies in home runs with 8.  Jung has slashed .262/.295/.667 the last two weeks and racked up 16 RBIs. Josh Jung was named the AL Rookie of the month for April for the AL West leading Texas Rangers. Jung is in the top 20% percentile in expected slugging and barrel rate. Jung has struggled at the plate striking out and taking walks.  But if Jung continues to hit for power, the Rangers can let that fact slide. Jung did have to leave a game after taking a pitch to his hand, but X-rays showed that no damage was done. 
3. **Hunter Brown (AL) -** As a rookie, Brown is currently hosting a 2.90 ERA. He is limiting hard contact, having above average rates in strikeouts (25.7% vs league average 22.5%) and ground balls (51.2% vs league average of 42.7%). He has yet to allow a home run and leads all rookie pitchers in innings pitched.  Brown struggled in his game against Atlanta allowing 4 ER off 7 hits but bounced back against the Rays giving 7 shutout innings against the AL leading Tampa Bay Rays. In his most recent outing, Brown took his first loss of the year going only 4.1 innings against the Giants allowing 2 runs off 2 hits. The Astros may need to rely on Brown more after losing Luis Garcia to Tommy John surgery and Jose Urquidy to a shoulder injury. Hunter Brown next scheduled start will be against the Los Angeles Angels on May 8th.
4. **Logan Allen (AL) -** Allen made his MLB debut April 23rd against the Miami Marlins. The Guardians #8 prospect went 6 innings and only allowed 1 ER. In his next start against the Boston Red Sox, Allen went 5 innings allowing only two ER. In both starts, Allen was able to rack up 8 strikeouts (16 total). Allen strikeout rate is in the 95% percentile, but comes on the downside that he allows a high barrel rate (4%). Allen is posed to lock himself in the Guardians depleted starting rotation for the time being. He looks to stun the Minnesota Twins on May 6th for his third start of the year.
5. **Tanner Bibee (AL) -** In addition to Allen, #5 Guardian prospect Tanner Bibee made his major league debut. In his major league debut on April 26th, Bibee struck out 8 while only allowing 1 ER in 5.2 innings of work. Bibee followed up his dominating start by going 5.1 innings and allowing 2 ER against the New York Yankees on May 2nd. Bibee has struck out 13 in his two starts. Bibee became the first Cleveland pitcher to strike out at least 5 consecutive batters since 1920.  Bibee has allowed no walks on the season and is a master at creating soft contact. He primarily throws a 4-seam and slider but has been able to generate strikeouts as well with his curveball. Bibee is scheduled to start again May 8th against the Detroit Tigers.
6. **Ryan Noda (AL) -** In less plate appearances, Ryan Noda has more doubles and the same amount of home runs as Gunnar Henderson and Anthony Volpe. Ryan Noda has walked  21 times on the year and has scored more runs than any other AL rookie not named Masataka Yoshida. Oaklands new first baseman has slugged the last two weeks. With two doubles and one home run, Noda has slashed a state line of .273/.329/515. Today Noda broke out of a slump by going 3-4 with two doubles, 3 RBIS, two walks, and three runs scored. Noda does need to work on his strikeout rate and whiff rate. But once these two metrics improve, watch out.

**National League:**

1. **Miguel Vargas (NL) -** The Dodgers cannot miss on their players. In his last 15 games, Vargas has racked up 12 RBIS off 12 hits. He slugged for 5 doubles, 2 home runs, and a triple, while scoring 8 runs in the process. Vargas' at-bats are producing runs and winning the Dodgers games in a left open after injuries. Vargas sees the ball well at the plate, having a high walk rate and low chase rate. Despite having a low hard hit rate and barrel rate, the 23rd second baseman continues to get on base. Vargas has been recovering from a right thumb injury, so Dodger fans should be optimistic that his improvements at the plate this week are only the beginning.
2. **Corbin Carroll (NL) -** Carroll continues to be the man to beat. Carroll was held out of a couple games for the Diamondbacks due to a lingering left knee injury. Eager to get Carroll back into the lineup, Carrol DHd Friday night to hit his 5th home run of the season. Despite missing three games Carroll has slashed .438/.538/.719 the last two weeks. Carroll also has 10 stolen bases on the season (and 2 CS) making him a good candidate for a 30-30 season. Carroll has also proven to be an elite defender in LF as well. Expect to see Carrolls name come up often in rookie of the year conversations.
3. **James Outman (NL) -** Despite what his name entails, Outman does not get out often. Outman hits. Outman hits hard. On the season, Outman is in the 60th percentile for expected slugging (80%), barrel rate (90%), and hard hit percentage (60%). In the last two weeks, Outman has 5 doubles and two home runs off 13 hits. Outman doesnt only hit though. Outman runs (and walks). Having a sprint speed in the top 87%, Outman has accumulated four stolen bases on the season with two coming in his last two weeks. Outman defends too. He has an above average jump on fly balls and has robbed many what would have been hits. Outman does not get out though.
4. **Brett Baty (NL) -** Brett Baty, after making his debut last month, is attempting to start up the Mets offense on his own. He has slashed .359/.419/.490 in the last two weeks and led all NL rookies in this time period in hits. The Mets #2 prospect, Baty is quickly making a case as one of the NLs leading rookies if he becomes an everyday player (currently it seems he is splitting time with Eduardo Escobar at 3B.
5. **Hayden Wesneski (NL) -** Wesneski in his last three starts leads all NL rookie pitchers in ERA (2.93). Despite giving up 14 hits, Wesneski only allowed 5 earned runs in 15.1 innings of work. The long ball has plagued Wesneski and he has been unable to tempt batters to chase out of the zone. Kyle Hendricks may return to the rotation soon, and Wesneski may be the odd man out. If the Cubs invoke his minor league option, this will give him time to work on his fastball command and tweak his cutter and changeup. Wesneski is set to start on May 7th against Sandy Alcantara and the Miami Marlins.
6. **Ezequiel Tovar (NL) -** Although SS is primarily a defensive position, it is a luxury when you can get some power from the position. In his last 15 games, Tovar had 3 doubles, 1 home run and a triple (slashing .268/.327/.556). Tovar is currently on a 7-game hitting streak and gives some Rockies fans a gleam of hope in a rough start to the season. Despite the good week, Tovar does in the bottom 15 percentile in whiff rate, strikeout rate, hard hit and barrel rate. But that is a problem for another week.

**Honorable Mention:** Ji Hwan Bae for stealing 9 bags in 15 games

# My Early Rookie of the Year

**American League:**

1. **Masataka Yoshida** \- See my blurb above.
2. **Josh Jung** \- See my blurb above.
3. **Hunter Brown** \- See my blurb above.
4. **Esteury Ruiz** \-  The Athletics center fielder leads all AL rookies in plate appearances, steals, doubles, and hits (ties with Yoshida). Ruiz was the first player  since 2019 to steal four bags in a single game. Ruiz stole 80 bags in the minors list year and can be a candidate to lead the entire MLB this year. As long as he is getting on base, Ruiz will be a threat too score (which can make up for the lack of power in his bat). 
5. **Ryan Noda** \- See my blurb above.

**Honorable Mentions:** Corey Julks, Anthony Volpe, Gunnar Henderson, Zach Neto

1. **Corbin Carroll** \- See the blurb above.
2. **James Outman** \- See the blurb above.
3. **Miguel Vargas** \- See the blurb above.
4. **Kendai Senga -**  In his last start, Senga pitched 6 innings of shut out ball against the Colorado Rockies. Senga continues to dominate the league with his ghost fork but lately has struggled in getting players to chase. Senga has walked 22 batters on the season but has been able to limit the damage. He currently leads all NL rookie starters in ERA and strikeouts (36). 
5. **Ji Hwan Bae -** Currently with 22 hits on the season, Bae leads all NL rookies in steals with 14. Bae has shined defensively, seemingly making highlight catches in the outfield on a daily basis. Bae hasnt had much power in his bat, primarily relying on his speed to get on base and score. Bae did end up leaving the Pirates game on May 5th with an ankle issue after trying to beat out a ground ball.
6. **Spenser Steer -** Although currently in a small slump, the starting Reds 3B had a strong start to the season to keep him in the conversation. Steer has struggled in the hot corner, performing below average at generating outs (-8% added success rate at 1B and -4% at 3B). Steer has hit the ball hard but struggles to get the barrel to the ball. Steer may attribute his struggles at the plate due to an injury in his knee, forcing the rookie to miss a couple of games. Once healed, Steer should be able to return to his pre-injury self.

**Honorable Mention:** Brett Baty (just needs to play more games), Jordan Walker

Mets have the advantage at 1B, 2B, SS, LF, and DH

Braves have the advantage at C, RF

CF and 3B (assuming Mets sign Correa) is a push. If Mets don't sign Correa advantage Braves at 3B.

I used 2022 final OPS+. Mets catcher Narvaez is penalized with this approach with a 71 OPS+ in 2022 vs. 100 for his career. Rosario and Acuna Jr are also penalized with their 2022 OPS+ vs. career averages of 105 and 133, respectively.

Grissom is a bit of a wild card. Nice prospect who arrived with a bang but his numbers came down after the hot start. No way is he in the same league with Lindor.

Albies is interesting. His back of the baseball card numbers are impressive for a 2B but yet his career OPS+ is just 106 vs. 128 for McNeil.

For Mets DH I assumed Vogelbach vs RHP and Escobar vs. LHP. I used an average of their sOPS+ 2022 numbers from Baseball Reference. For the Braves I assumed d'Arnaud is the DH. I don't know how Ozuna fits into their plans although more Ozuna doesn't help the Braves overall average OPS+, it hurts it.

Caveat: I'm a Mets fan but tried to be objective. I think the Mets lineup is deeper and overall better and with the pending arrival of highly touted C prospect Francisco Alvarez in the 2nd half of 2023 they have a chance to put up the best lineup in baseball with no weaknesses at any position.

The perennial NL East champs Braves are the still the team to beat and also have an incredible lineup with all-star caliber players throughout the lineup but I see uncertainty at SS and LF.

#From A Great and Glorious Game: Baseball Writings of A. Bartlett Giamatti

*by A. Bartlett Giamatti, et al*


**""The Green Fields of the Mind ""**


It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops. Today, October 2, a Sunday of rain and broken branches and leaf-clogged drains and slick streets, it stopped, and summer was gone.


Somehow, the summer seemed to slip by faster this time. Maybe it wasn't this summer, but all the summers that, in this my fortieth summer, slipped by so fast. There comes a time when every summer will have something of autumn about it. Whatever the reason, it seemed to me that I was investing more and more in baseball, making the game do more of the work that keeps time fat and slow and lazy. I was counting on the game's deep patterns, three strikes, three outs, three times three innings, and its deepest impulse, to go out and back, to leave and to return home, to set the order of the day and to organize the daylight. I wrote a few things this last summer, this summer that did not last, nothing grand but some things, and yet that work was just camouflage. The real activity was done with the radio--not the all-seeing, all-falsifying television--and was the playing of the game in the only place it will last, the enclosed green field of the mind. There, in that warm, bright place, what the old poet called Mutability does not so quickly come.


But out here, on Sunday, October 2, where it rains all day, Dame Mutability never loses. She was in the crowd at Fenway yesterday, a gray day full of bluster and contradiction, when the Red Sox came up in the last of the ninth trailing Baltimore 8-5, while the Yankees, rain-delayed against Detroit, only needing to win one or have Boston lose one to win it all, sat in New York washing down cold cuts with beer and watching the Boston game. Boston had won two, the Yankees had lost two, and suddenly it seemed as if the whole season might go to the last day, or beyond, except here was Boston losing 8-5, while New York sat in its family room and put its feet up. Lynn, both ankles hurting now as they had in July, hits a single down the right-field line. The crowd stirs. It is on its feet. Hobson, third baseman, former Bear Bryant quarterback, strong, quiet, over 100 RBIs, goes for three breaking balls and is out. The goddess smiles and encourages her agent, a canny journeyman named Nelson Briles.

Now comes a pinch hitter, Bernie Carbo, onetime Rookie of the Year, erratic, quick, a shade too handsome, so laid-back he is always, in his soul, stretched out in the tall grass, one arm under his head, watching the clouds and laughing; now he looks over some low stuff unworthy of him and then, uncoiling, sends one out, straight on a rising line, over the center-field wall, no cheap Fenway shot, but all of it, the physics as elegant as the arc the ball describes.


New England is on its feet, roaring. The summer will not pass. Roaring, they recall the evening, late and cold, in 1975, the sixth game of the World Series, perhaps the greatest baseball game played in the last fifty years, when Carbo, loose and easy, had uncoiled to tie the game that Fisk would win. It is 8-7, one out, and school will never start, rain will never come, sun will warm the back of your neck forever. Now Bailey, picked up from the National League recently, big arms, heavy gut, experienced, new to the league and the club; he fouls off two and then, checking, tentative, a big man off balance, he pops a soft liner to the first baseman. It is suddenly darker and later, and the announcer doing the game coast to coast, a New Yorker who works for a New York television station, sounds relieved. His little world, well-lit, hot-combed, split-second-timed, had no capacity to absorb this much gritty, grainy, contrary reality.


Cox swings a bat, stretches his long arms, bends his back, the rookie from Pawtucket who broke in two weeks earlier with a record six straight hits, the kid drafted ahead of Fred Lynn, rangy, smooth, cool. The count runs two and two, Briles is cagey, nothing too good, and Cox swings, the ball beginning toward the mound and then, in a jaunty, wayward dance, skipping past Briles, feinting to the right, skimming the last of the grass, finding the dirt, moving now like some small, purposeful marine creature negotiating the green deep, easily avoiding the jagged rock of second base, traveling steady and straight now out into the dark, silent recesses of center field.


The aisles are jammed, the place is on its feet, the wrappers, the programs, the Coke cups and peanut shells, the detritus of an afternoon; the anxieties, the things that have to be done tomorrow, the regrets about yesterday, the accumulation of a summer: all forgotten, while hope, the anchor, bites and takes hold where a moment before it seemed we would be swept out with the tide. Rice is up. Rice whom Aaron had said was the only one he'd seen with the ability to break his records. Rice the best clutch hitter on the club, with the best slugging percentage in the league. Rice, so quick and strong he once checked his swing halfway through and snapped the bat in two. Rice the Hammer of God sent to scourge the Yankees, the sound was overwhelming, fathers pounded their sons on the back, cars pulled off the road, households froze, New England exulted in its blessedness, and roared its thanks for all good things, for Rice and for a summer stretching halfway through October. Briles threw, Rice swung, and it was over. One pitch, a fly to center, and it stopped. Summer died in New England and like rain sliding off a roof, the crowd slipped out of Fenway, quickly, with only a steady murmur of concern for the drive ahead remaining of the roar. Mutability had turned the seasons and translated hope to memory once again. And, once again, she had used baseball, our best invention to stay change, to bring change on.


That is why it breaks my heart, that game--not because in New York they could win because Boston lost; in that, there is a rough justice, and a reminder to the Yankees of how slight and fragile are the circumstances that exalt one group of human beings over another. It breaks my heart because it was meant to, because it was meant to foster in me again the illusion that there was something abiding, some pattern and some impulse that could come together to make a reality that would resist the corrosion; and because, after it had fostered again that most hungered-for illusion, the game was meant to stop, and betray precisely what it promised.


Of course, there are those who learn after the first few times. They grow out of sports. And there are others who were born with the wisdom to know that nothing lasts. These are the truly tough among us, the ones who can live without illusion, or without even the hope of illusion. I am not that grown-up or up-to-date. I am a simpler creature, tied to more primitive patterns and cycles. I need to think something lasts forever, and it might as well be that state of being that is a game; it might as well be that, in a green field, in the sun.

"2023-06-05",1685986481,"MLB is a sport divided by historic payroll disparity -- so what's next?","Read this recent article and got into a discussion with my friend about this. His perspective is that allowing essentially unregulated (taxed) payrolls in baseball is more democratic (my words not his). It allows billionaire owners the freedom to run the teams as they see fit. I think otherwise. The A's and their ilk are getting collectively worse and worse each year, trend-wise. Yes the article makes sure to point out that the orioles from this year are outliers, and it does essentially make the point that some of that can be chalked up to ""that's why we don't play the game on paper"", but from a  fan perspective, roughly 1/3 of the league is essentially non-competitive YOY. They're basically fodder for teams who actually are able to compete

As far as ratings, the last three World Series have three of the lowest ratings of all time and they included the Astros twice and the dodgers, each a top-five payroll team. I don't think the correlation between having ""big market"" teams and a fun/competitive/interesting WS is necessarily the case.

Regardless, I dont actually think that looking at who wins or even gets into the World Series is a good yardstick. Once you get into the playoffs any team can get hot or cold, particularly in a shorter series. I think a better metric is the regular season, who can ROUTINELY get IN to the postseason. And while expanding the number of wild card teams helps with this particular issue (something I'm not a fan of for totally different reasons, I don't like the idea of .500 teams regularly earning wildcard spots..., see above re: anyone can get hot and I do want the best teams playing at that time of year), I don't think theres a lot of room to argue that a higher payroll is firmly correlated with a more regular appearance in October/sustained regular season success. And with more postseason appearances comes a better shot at being that hot team. 

When it comes to fan viewership outside of the local fan base, I think that getting non-local fans to be interested in your team is about having player recognition YOY and consistently being competitive so that outsiders see your team as being competitive and being able to put together good games. All the more reason why ""Cinderella"" teams aren't big out of market draws.

Rant over. Interested to hear other takes

Note: my friend does make really good points that I would be remiss not to include in this discussion. Rather than restate his words again, here was his response to me:

What I do think needs to be controlled/monitored is the cost for fans. Baseball has gotten really expensive. A decent ticket to a baseball game can be close to the same price as a football game. Football has 8 home games. Baseball has 81. The prices should not be similar.

I think Baseball is different. Angels attendance and viewership went down after getting Mike Trout. After getting Ohtani, the pandemic obviously affected everything, but even this year, the Angels average 10,000 fans fewer per game than pre-Trout. 

The issue for baseball isn't that there aren't enough superstars on bad teams. The bigger issue is accessibility. It's too expensive to go to games and it's too hard to watch games on TV. 

I also think the last 3 years WS being the lowest rated are more of a referendum on the state of Baseball than on the teams that were in it. Which is part of the reason that such drastic changes were made this year.","baseball",44,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/141lzdx/mlb_is_a_sport_divided_by_historic_payroll/"
"2023-06-03",1685799338,"Rookie Bi-Weekly Analysis #4","#  Rookie Performance Evaluation 4

With so many players in the MLB, some of the newest players get lost behind some of the high profile names. We are here today to evaluate every rookie who has played this year and highlight the top performances of the last two weeks and for the entire year. This week Josh Jung murdered some baseballs, Grant Anderson struck out seven in his debut out of the bullpen, and Bobby Miller shut down the Braves (and Nats).

# Top Bi-Weekly Performances

**American League:**

1. **Josh Jung (TEX 3B):** Josh Jung continues to dominate at the plate, winning back to back AL rookie of the month awards in April and May. Josh Jung ended the month of May by slugging for 5 doubles, 1 triple and 4 home runs. Jung leads all third baseman in runs and batting average and leads all rookie batters in runs (4), hits (61), home runs (12), and RBIs (37). In his last 10 games, Jung  had 9 extra base hits. Offensively, Jung is already worth 2 WAR and has only gotten better throughout the year. Jung sees the ball well, hitting 50.5% over 95 mph (top 90% in the league) and has been able to barrel 12.2% of pitches seen (top 81% in the league). Defensively Josh Jung is in the bottom half of 3rd baseman, having negative -2 defensive runs saved and -1 outs above average. Despite his below average defense, Josh Jung has been one of the best third baseman in the majors all season.
2. **Masataka Yoshida (BOS LF):** The Japanese superstar is doing all he can to keep the Red Sox afloat.  Yoshida continues his hot streak, batting .348/.412/.500 in the the last 15 days. After a somewhat slow start to the season, Yoshida has emerged as one of the two big favorites for AL rookie of the year (along with Josh Jung). Yoshida still only has 21 strikeouts and walks on the year through 48 games on the season. Yoshida will put the ball in play and will rarely kill a batting rally with a strikeout. He hardly chases the ball and is top in the league on whiff rate. Yoshida has adapted to MLB pitching very quickly and will remain a superstar for years to come.
3. **Logan Allen (CLE SP)**: The Guardians have a loaded starting pitching staff with the return of Aaron Civale and Triston McKenzie. Logan Allen, along with rookies Tanner Bibee, Hunter Gaddis, and Peyton Battenfield, has shined in the starting rotation. Allen had his best game of the season, going 7 innings against the Baltimore Orioles allowing only 3 hits, no earned runs, and striking out 10. Through 7 starts in the year. In his last three starts, Allen has only allowed 4 earned runs through 18.2 innings. Of the four rookie starting pitchers for Cleveland, Allen has pitched the most innings (39.2) and holds the lowest ERA (2.72). Allens next start is scheduled on June 3rd against the Minnesota Twins.
4. **Louie Varland (MIN SP):** Varland pitched seven shutout innings against the Houston Astros. Varland has pitched back-to-back quality starts in 4 of his last five starts. The only game Varland did not get a quality start was against the Angels, where he gave up only 2 earned runs in 5 innings. Varland primarily throws a 4-seam (42%) and cutter (30%) and goes to his slider (12%) and changeup (12%) to put batters away. Varland hardly walks batters but gives up a lot of hard contact. Nonetheless Varland has pitched effectively, limiting the damage done in most games he has started. Varland's next start is projected to be on June 6th against the Tampa Bay Rays.
5. **Ryan Noda  (OAK 1B):** Ryan Noda powered a three-run home run to snap the Athletics  11-game losing streak. In the last 15 games, Noda has batted .256 with 3 home runs and 3 doubles on 11 hits. Noda hits 48.2% of balls 95 mph or higher and barrels 16.9% of pitches. Despite this, Noda ranks in the bottom percentile in whiff rate. Noda whiffs on 36% of fast balls, 42% in breaking balls, and 38% of offspeed pitches. Noda has struck out in 33% of his plate appearances (61 strikeout total) but simultaneously ranks in the top percentile in walks taken (35 walks total). 
6. **Zach Neto (LAA SS):** Despite all the preseason hype for Anthony Volpe and Gunnar Henderson, Zach Neto has quietly emerged as the most consistent bat for rookie AL shortstops. Only 22 years old, Neto was the first player from the 2022 MLB draft to make the majors. Defensively, Neto has been steller. In 44 games, Neto has already racked up .8 defensive war and has generated 2 more outs above average than other shortstops. In the last 15 days, Neto has 11 hits with 4 doubles and a home run. Neto had small injury scare against the Marlins with a finger contusion, but has already made it back into the starting lineup.
7. **Grant Anderson (TEX RP):** Grant Anderson has only played in one game this season but I figured he deserved a special shoutout. In his major league debut, Anderson pitched  2 and 2/3rd innings out of the bullpen striking out 7 of the 9 batters. Anderson only gave up one hit and earned the win against the Detroit Tigers.

**National League:**

1. **Bobby Miller (LAD SP):** The Dodgers #2 prospect has done nothing but impress. In his first two starts on the season, Miller has posted a 1.64 ERA through 11 innings. Miller equally throws a sinker, changeup, slider, and 4-seam fastball. On his fastball, Miller averages 99 mph on his sinkers and 4-seam and sometimes will go to his curveball to strike out batters. In his debut, Miller went 5 innings and only one earned run on 4 hits against the Atlanta Braves. He followed his debut by going 6 innings, allowing only 1 earned run on four hits. Bobby Miller's next scheduled start is June 4th against the New York Yankees.
2. **Spencer Steer (CIN 3B):** Spencer Steer uses every side of the field. In the last 15 days, Steer has batted .389/.424/.667 with 4 doubles, one triple, and three home runs. Steer currently leads NL rookies in hits (59), RBIs (T28 with Outman), and doubles (T15 with Tovar). Steer has recently returned to his 2022 self hitting 8 home runs on the season and putting the ball consistently in play. Steer has struggled greatly defensively with -8 outs above average at both first and third base and generating -.4 WAR on the season. He ranks in the bottom 1% of outs above average and, when fielding, is completely 7% of plays as expected at both first base and third base. Despite these struggles, Steers production at the plate has lead him to be named the National League Rookie of the month for May.
3. **Matt McLain (CIN SS):**  The Reds #5 prospect made his major league debut after TJ Friedl was moved to the 10-day injured list . In the last 15 days, McLain has the most at bats (57), hits (T21 Steer) and runs (T11 Steer) in the National League. McLain won this weeks player of week and continues to bat .329/.390/.486 in 16 games. McLain is primarily causing damage against fastballs and breaking balls, batting over .400 on such pitches.  Defensively, McLain has been stellar. In only 16 games, he has generated 2 outs above average at shortstop and has added 5% success rate at the  position off 43 attempts. If McLain can continue his success at the plate, along with fellow ROY contender Spencer Steer, then they can help Cincinnati compete for a relatively week NL Central division (who knows what may happen if the Reds call up fellow shortstop Elly de la Cruz).
4. **Corbin Carroll (ARZ LF):** Corbin Carroll continues to impress and at this point I feel like I am repeating myself. The 22 year old left-fielder has power, defense, and speed. Carroll has helped the Diamondbacks to take control (or at least tie) in the National League West. In the past 15 days, Carroll has slugged for 4 doubles and three home runs on 15 hits. He leads the national league in stolen bases and has a real shot at joining the 20 / 20 club as a rookie. On the year, Carrolls slash line is .287/.372/.516. Of all rookies, Corbin Carroll leads in WAR, already accumulating 2.1 on offense. On the defensive side of the ball, Carrol has generated 2 outs above average and has added 2% to the expected fielding average in left field. Expect to see Carroll on these lists for the rest of the season.
5. **Patrick Bailey (SF C):** Joey Bart was thought to be the replacement at catcher for the San Francisco after the departure of Buster Posey. With everyones focus on Bart, Bailey went under the radar. In 11 games, Bailey has batted  .333/.350/.564 with 12 hits, of which 3 were doubles and 2 were home runs. In the minors. Bailey was praised for his framing abilities behind the plate. If Bailey can continue his success at the plate, San Francisco may be posed well at the catcher position for years to come.
6. **Will Brennan (CLE RF)** \- Although he is not a batter that consistently hits the ball hard, Will Brennan, in the last 15 days, has 12 hits in 12 games including 3 doubles and 1 home run.. He is batting .364/.400/.515 and has been reliable at the plate when batters are at first base. Brennan has a batting average of .318 with a runner at 1st (23 plate appearances) and batting .500 with runners at 1st and 2nd (6 plate appearances). Though Will Brennan did kill a bird on a ground-ball single last week. So& he has that going against him.

# Worst Bi-Weekly Performances:

1. **Brice Turang (MIL 2B) -** In the last 14 games, Turang is batting only .077/.122/.154. In his last seven games, Turang only has one base hit. In his last 15, Turang only has 3. Turang, on the season, has struck out in 27% of his plate appearances and barrels on only 3.6% of pitches. Turang primarily is struggling in making contact with offspeed pitches, whiffing on 40% of those seen. 
2. **James Outman (LAD OF) -** After starting the season hitting everything out of the park, Outman bat has cooled off immensely. In his last 10 games, Outman only has two singles and is batting .074/.182/.074. Outman hits the ball hard when he makes contact, but has whiffed on 40.4% of pitches seen. Outman has striked out in 35% of his at bats. Outman leads all rookies in strikeouts and 5th in the majors. Defensively, Outman has been above average in furling in the outfield. He is converting 3% more outs than estimated success rate and has created 3 outs above average in the outfield. 
3. **Anthony Volpe (NYY SS) -** Defensively, Anthony Volpe has been phenomenal at shortstop. The Yankees #1 prospect is only 22 years old and already has .7 defensive war. Volpe has recently struggled at the plate. He is second among rookie pitchers in strikeouts (68) and 8th in the majors. On the season, Volpe is only batting .192/.270/.355. But when Volpe does get a hit, he hits for power and brings speed on the basepaths. Volpe has 13 steals on the season and has yet to be caught stealing. 
4. **Karl Kauffmann (COL SP) -** Kauffmann made his major league debut on May 19th and has not had a good time. In three starts, Kaufman has posted an 11.37 ERA and earned 3 losses. In his first start, Kauffman went 4.1 innings against Texas and allowed 4 earned runs off seven hits. In his next start, Kaugment again went 4.1 innings against Miami ang gave up 5 earned runs on 6 hits. In his final game, he went 4.0 innings against Arizona and allowed 7 earned runs on 9 hits. In all three games combined, Kauffman only struck out 7 and walked 8. Kauffman is only averaging 90 mph on his fastball and has left too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone. 

Shout out to Miles Mastrobuoni as well who is batting .053 in 9 games (19 plate appearances) and for having an ERA of 108.

# My Early Rookie of the Year

**American League:**

1. **Masataka Yoshida** (**BOS LF)** \-  See my blurb above
2. **Josh Jung (TEX 3B) -** See my blurb above
3. **Esteury Ruiz (OAK CF) -**  In 58 games, Ruiz is already at 28 stolen bases. ALthough Ruiz is not hitting for extreme power, his speed is turning almost half of his base hits into what is essentially a double. In most offenses that are not the Oakland Athletics, this would typically translate to more runs and have them take leads early on balls just put in play. Among qualified rookies in the American league, Ruiz ranks 3rd in batting average, T1st (with Jung) in hits, and 1st in doubles. Ruiz does rank in the bottom percentile for hard hit percentage (1%), barrel rate (5%) and walk rate (5%).
4. **Hunter Brown (HOU SP) -** In 11 games, Hunter brown has a 3.64 ERA and recently overtaken Kodai Senga for the lead in strikeouts for rookie pitchers. Brown struggled in his last start against Minnesota, giving up 5 earned runs on  6 hits. This was after Brown had pitched back-to-back quality starts against the Oakland As (7 IP 2 ER and 6 IP 1 ER). 
5. **Logan Allen (CLE SP) -** See my blurb above
6. **Bryce Miller (SEA SP)  -**  The Mariners #2 prospect dominated the league in his first five starts going at least 6 innings in each and allowing only four runs in total. Miller only had one hiccup game in which he allowed 8 earned runs in 4.2 innings against the New York Yankees. Miller's success has  been largely in part in limiting walks and throwing many strikes for weak contact. Miller is top in the league in walk rate only allowing walks in 2% of at bats. Miller primarily throws his fastball 68% of the time and goes to his offspeed pitchers to put batters away. Miller is set to start on June 4th against Nathan Eovaldi of the Texas Rangers.
7. **Yennier Cano (BAL RP) -** In his first 9 innings of the year, Cano did not allow a single base hit.  Can has 30 strikeouts on the season through 30 innings of relief. In 5 save opportunities, Cano has successfully earned 4 saves with a 0.93 ERA and a WHIP of 0.59. Cano remains the secondary closer behind Felix Bautista, used primarily to maintain leads in close games and as the set-up man for the 9th inning.

**National League:**

1. **Corbin Carroll (ARZ LF):** See my blurb above.
2. **Spencer Steer (CIN 3B):** See my blurb above.
3. **Kodai Senga (NYM SP):** In his last start, Kodai Senga pitched 7 innings of 1 hit baseball against the Philadelphia Phillies. Senga ranks first among national league pitchers in strikeouts and second in innings pitched (behind Ryne Nelson). Kodai Senga strikes out 29.8% of batters but gives up lots of hard contact. Batters are still only batting .125 against his ghost fork and strikes out 59.1% of batters as a putaway pitch. This is primarily because batters have a 59.1% whiff rate on his forkball (66 PA) and his slider (7 PA). Senga is scheduled to pitch on June 4th against the Toronto Blue Jays Yusei Kikuchi.
4. **Ezquiel Tovar ( COL SS):** In 55 games on the season, the Colorado shortstop has accumulated 46 base hits in 55 games. Tovar leads all NL rookies in doubles (16) and is currently slashing .241/.286/.398. Defensively, Tovar has been exceptional at shortstop accumulating 0.9 defensive war. Tovar has 6 outs above average at shortstop and has successfully converted 3% more plays than the estimated success rate.  
5. **James Outman (LAD CF):** See my blurb above.
6. **Francisco Alvarez (NYM C):** The Mets #1 prospect has taken the league by storm. Alvarez has been above average in framing especially above the zone and has 5 blocks above average. Alvarez however has struggled in maintaining run control having -3 CS above average. At the plate, Alvarez has 6 doubles and 8 home runs on the season in 35 games with a slash line of .252/.308/.523.

This games highlights and unfortunate lowlight centered around Drew Smyly. Smyly had a perfect game rolling into the 8th inning, but then disaster struck. David Peralta broke his bat on a weak dribbler up the third base line in front of Smyly. As he and catcher Yan Gomes converged in a rush the field the ball, Gomes was unable to stop his momentum and ended up effectively tackling Smyly, who was unable to throw the ball. Perfect game and no-hitter gone. However, the Cubs had an authoritative win despite this as Nico Hoerner led the Cubs to dropping a bakers dozen with 4 hits including his first homer of the year. Bellinger again homered off of his former team and Patrick Wisdom hit homer number 9.

The Pirates grab their 5th win in a row as they continue to surprise the MLB with their early success despite the loss of their freak-of-nature shortstop Oniel Cruz. Connor Joe continued his hot start, going 3/3 and raising his batting average over the past week to .423. Mark Mathias hit a 2 RBI single to start the scoring in the 2nd and the Reds would get two in the fifth as Nick Senzel and Jose Barrero each drove in a run to tie the game.

This game was a thriller: lots of early runs and a dramatic walk-off win for Tampa. The Rays got on the board first as Josh Lowe doubled home Brandon Lowe and Randy Arozarena in the 1st. Harold Ramirez followed that up by launching a ball 415 feet to center to put the Rays up 4-0. The White Sox then scored all 7 of their runs between the 2nd and 4th innings with a trio of RBI singles, a pair of RBI walks, and a solo shot from Eloy Jimenez. Yandy Diaz would give the Rays another in the 4th with an RBI single but the score would hold at 7-5 into the 9th. This is where things got interesting.

Rockies (6-14) at Phillies (8-12)  Final: Phillies defeat Rockies 4-3

Ryan McMahon hit a 3-run big fly in the first, but that would be all the Rockies would get off of Aaron Nola, who locked in after this. Rockies starter Noah Davis was stingy, only giving up one earned run on a Jake Cave infield single over 4.2 innings of work in addition to an unearned run thanks to a McMahon error. Kyle Schwarber would tie the game by driving a line drive out to right in the 7th. Edmundo Sosa then drove in the go ahead run in the 8th putting the Phillies up 4-3.

Bautista got two outs, but in the process allowed Akil Baddoo to reach second. Javy Baez managed to single Baddoo home and tie the game. This was the first run the Orioles pitching staff had allowed after 34 scoreless innings. Not much harm came from the Tigers getting this run as the Orioles were still able to walk off the game in the bottom of the 9th as Adam Frazier drove in Ryan Mountcastle with a grounder to first.

Padres (10-11) at Diamondback (11-9)  Final: Diamondbacks defeat Padres 9-0

With 7 scoreless innings in which he struck out 11 Padres, Gallen extended his streak of scoreless innings to 21.2 innings. This comes after last season as Gallen had a streak of 44.1 innings of allowing no runs. He is simply dominant.

Game to watch  Yankees at Blue Jays:

There are a handful of great games tomorrow, so Ill give some honorable mentions: Dylan Cease vs Shane McClanahan in White Sox vs Rays, Framber Valdez vs Kyle Wright in Astros vs Braves, Joe Musgrove vs Merrill Kelley in Padres vs Diamondbacks. All these games lost out to the Blue Jays at Yankees however as Gerrit Cole and Alek Manoah face off in an inner-division showdown. In prior matchups with Manoah, the Yankees lineup is only hitting a combined .186 against him and Cole is coming off a dominant complete game shutout. Both offenses have a lot of firepower and both teams have their ace on the mound.","baseball",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12vcirj/daily_rundown_for_42123/"

Game to watch  Astros at Rays:

Two of the favorites to represent the AL in the World Series matchup for a 3-game set. The Rays will have rookie Taj Bradley going who has a K% in the 98th percentile, albeit in only two starts. Jose Urquidy gets outs in a different way, being 90th percentile in average exit velocity. Either way, these pitchers will have their work cut out for them as the Rays have scored the most runs in baseball with 149 and the Astros have scored the 6th most at 113.

"2023-05-20",1684565936,"Rookie Bi-Weekly Analysis #4","#  Rookie Performance Evaluation 4

With so many players in the MLB, some of the newest players get lost behind some of the high profile names. We are here today to evaluate every rookie who has played this year and highlight the top performances of the last two weeks and for the entire year. This week Esterury Ruiz continues to cause havoc on the basepaths, Francisco Alvarez was picked-off with the bases loaded, and Casey Schmidt and Dominic Fletcher take the league by storm.

# Top Bi-Weekly Performances

**American League:**

1. **Bryce Miller  (**SEA SP) **-**  Bryce Miller continued strong after his  debut on May 2th. Miller has made two starts in the last two weeks going 7 innings against Detroit but only 6.0 innings against Atlanta. In his last three starts Miller has only allowed 7 hits and 1 ER. Miller primarily relies on his fastball and uses his curveball, slider, and changeup to put batters away. His fastball averages 96 mph Miller is able to entice batters to chase outside the zone (85% percentile) and does not give up many hard hits (84% percentile). Bryce Miller is scheduled to pitch next on May 19th against the Atlanta Braves.
2. **Louie Varland (MIN SP) -** The Minnesota Twins right hander pitched 12.1 innings, struck out 13, walked 3 batters, and allowed only 4 earned runs. Varlond went 6 inning against the Padres, allowing 1 earned run on five hits and went 6.1 innings against the cubs allowing 3 earned runs off 4 hits. Varland was called up last month when Kenta Maeda went on the IL. Varland strikes out players at an above average rate (78% percentile),  but allows a lot of hard contact. Varlunds next scheduled start is on May 20th against the Los Angeles Angels. 
3. **Esteury Ruiz (OAK CF)** \- In the last 15 games, no other rookie has more hits (18), at bats (60), stolen bases (9),  or doubles (5) than Esteury Ruiz. Over this time period, Ruiz has a .300/.344/.433. On the season, Ruiz leads MLB with 21 steals and 10 HBP. Ruiz is primarily a threat on the basebaths. Although he is not a power threat at the plate, Ruiz did hit his first MLB home run against the Texas Rangers on May 12th. Ruiz does rank low in most batting categories. Ruiz ranks in the 1in the bottom 18th percentile in average exit velocity (1%), hard hit percentage (3%), expected slugging percentage (11%), barrel percentage (11%), walk percentage (5%), and chase rate (18%). Ruiz also seems to struggle defensively, having a -0.8 war on the season with below average outfielder jump (35%) and outs above average (40%) Despite these metrics, Ruiz continues to get on base at a respectable rate and continues to contribute to keep the As in games. 
4. **Triston Casas (BOS 1B)** \- In a week where many AL batters struggled, Triston Cases has begun to find a rhythm at the plate. In 10 games, Casas has 7 base hits in 24 at bats including 3 home runs. Casas has more walks (6) than strikeouts (5) in this time period, showing a more aggressiveness at the plate than earlier in the season. Casas had a slow start to the season and currently is sitting on a .188/.340/.366 slash line. Casas has struggled against left-handed pitching, batting only .174 against southpaws (though he is also only batting .191 against right-handers). Nonetheless, Casas currently has been a red-hot batter and looking to continue his success at the plate through an entire month.
5. **Anthony Volpe (NYY SS)** \- Although he has only batted .207/.270/.466 in the last 15 days, Anthony Volpe had a strong performance over the week. Volpe is only 22 years old and is currently playing everyday at a vital defensive position.  Volpe led all AL batters with 9 RBIs and 7 runs scored. Volpe had 12 hits with 1 double, 1 triple, and 4 home runs over the last 15 days. Although he doesnt have the aggregate numbers, Volpe hits come when they are needed most. He currently leads all rookies in offensive WAR (1.4) and defensive WAR (0.7) on the season.
6. **Ryan Noda (OAK 1B) -** Noda two-out, 7th inning grand slam against the Arizona D-backs helped lead the As to their 10th win on the season. On the season, Noda has recorded 14 RBIs and has scored 22 runs.  He leads all rookies in walks showing great patience at the plate. Of all qualified AL rookies, Noda ranks second behind Masataka Yoshida in OPS. Noda gives the As chances to come back in games and while continuing to improve (if he ever gets protections around him in the batting line-up).

**National League:**

1. **Kodai Senga** (NYM P) - Senga had a career day on May 17th striking out 12 against the AL leading Tampa Bay Rays. Senga went 6 innings allowing 1 ER off 3 hits against the Rays, 5 innings allowing 5 ER off 8 hits against the Reds, and 6 innings allowing no runs off 2 hits against the Colorado Rockies. Senga continues to lead all rookie pitchers in strikeouts (55). Senga continues to dominate the league with his ghost fork throwing it 166 times with a 58% whiff rate and no hard batted balls. Only five batters have got a hit off  Sengas forkball all resulting in a weak single. Senga is scheduled to pitch next against the Chicago Cubs on May 23rd.
2. **Dominic Fletcher (ARI RF) -**  The Arizona right fielder is one of the hottest hitters currently in the major league. FLetcher debuted for the Arizona on April 30th. He is currently slashing .374/.407/.607 and has emerged as a threat at the plate. In only 16 starts of the season, Fletcher has already  accumulated 1.00 Offensive WAR and 0.3 Defensive WAR. Fletcher has slugged for 5 doubles, 1 triple, and two home runs in the last 15 days. Fletcher was key in Arizonas only win against the Athletics when he threw-out Tony Kemp at home-plate on Ruizs bases loaded, RBI single. Dominic Fletcher had a career day against the San Francisco Giants knocking in 5 with a three-run triple and a two-run home run. Fletcher is looking to solidify himself in the Arizona Diamondbacks lineup next to other  ROY candidate Corbin Carroll. With both of them in the lineup, the Diamondbacks pose themselves as a future power threat.
3. **Brenton Doyle (COL CF)** \- Doyles two home run day helped the Rockies outslug the Cincinnati Reds to a 9-8 victory on May 15th. In 12 games, Doyle has 10 hits with 1 double, 1 triple, and 4 home runs in the last 15 days. On the season, Doyle is slashing .237.274/.508.  In addition to providing vital at-bats, Doyle has emerged as an elite defender.  Doyle ranks in the top percentile for outfielder jump (87%), sprint speed (98%), outs above average (88%), and arm strength (99%). Brenton Doyle already has 3 outfield assists, including throwing out Pirate Bryan Reynolds at home plate off Castros shallow fly ball. 
4. **Casey Schmitt (SF 3B/SS)** \- Schmitt made his MLB debut on May 9th, 2023, after the Giants DFAd Darin Ruf and optioned Cal Stevenson to Triple-A Sacramento. In his first 9 games of his MLB career, Schmitt has accumulated 15 hits with 4 doubles, 2 home runs, and 8 RBIs. Casey Schmitt is currently slashing .410/.410/.667 on the season. Schmitt's first hit was a home run in his second at bat of his debut and has continued to rake since. Schmitt is a versatile infield defender and has earned some fame for his arm strength throwing 92.9mph. His throw currently is the hardest thrown ball by an infielder so far this year beating out ONeil Cruz 92.8mph thrown on May 5th.
5. **Francisco Alvarez (NYM C) -** The 21 year old catcher was able to make his debut after Omar Narvaez landed on the IL last month. In the last 15 days, Francisco Alvarez has slashed .270/.372/.676 with 3 doubles and 4 home runs. Alvarez has emerged as the starting catcher since Omar Narvaez landed on the IL. Alvarez has shown to be above average in blocking wild pitchers but below average in catching base runners stealing. Alvarez ranks in the 91% percentile in framing getting higher than average strike calls above the zone. IF the youngster continues his success on offense, he can prove himself as one of the league's best offensive catchers in the league.
6. **Spencer Steer (CIN 3B/1B) -** In a week where many of the frontrunners for NL ROY struggled, Spencer Steer continued his recent hot streak at the plate. Slashing .286/.386/.510 with 5 doubles and 2 home runs steer has slowly recovered from his slow start to the season. Steer has struggled immensely on defense, losing 8% success rate at first base and 4% at third base against the estimated success rate. Steer has 5 fielding errors on the year, but continues to provide run support at the plate.

# My Early Rookie of the Year

**American League:**

1. **Masataka Yoshida** \-  Yoshida continues to lead all qualified rookies in batting average (.299), slugging (.493) and RBIs (28). Despite spending some time on the IL, Yoshida ranks second among all rookies in hits (43), doubles (8) and runs (26). Yoshida continues to rank in the top 70% of all major batting metrics but has preformed below average in defense. Yoshidas rarest oddity might be his plate vision. Yoshida, unlike almost all other MLB batters, has more walks (16) than strikeouts (15). The Japanese superstar is showing to be just as good as advertised, if not better.
2. **Esteury Ruiz** \-  See my blurb above
3. **Josh Jung** \- Jung leads all rookies in home runs (8) and runs (27). On the season, Jung has 7 doubles and 8 home runs. Jung has provided a steady power bat in a deadly Texas Rangers lineup. Jung is providing the Rangers with the run support needed to win close games and has been steady enough on defense to remain in the field. Jung seems to do his best against fastballs and offspeed, batting .253 and .308 respectively. Jung does the most damage however off the breaking ball (5 HR and 4 doubles. 
4. **Hunter Brown** \- Hunter Brown continues to prove himself as a dominating force on the mound. Brown has a 3.43 ERA on the season with 47 strikeouts. Brown struggled in his last two starts allowing 3 earned runs to the White Sox in 5.2 innings and 4 earned runs to the Angels in 4.1 innings. Batters have been able to pick up on Browns slider (BA .311) and recently done some damage off his fastball. Nonetheless, Brown  has proved to be one of the best rookie pitchers in the AL. Though he may soon see stiff competition from rival Mariners righthander, Bryce Miller. Brown is looking to get back on track against the Athletics on May 20th.
5. **Anthony Volpe** \- See my blurb above.

**National League:**

1. **James Outman (LAD CF) -** Outman is currently my favorite to win ROY in the NL. On the season he currently leads the NL in home runs (9), hits (4), triples (3), and runs (28). Outman currently in his last 15 games has only batted .200, Outman continues to come up big for the Dodgers. Outman hit a go-ahead grand-slam over the Twins on May 17th and robbed last years NL MVP Paul Goldschmidt of an extra base hit at the wall on May 19th. Outman has struggled with strikeouts with 59 strikeouts on the season (most among all rookies). Only Teaoscar Hernandez and Matt Olson have more strikeouts this season. As long as Outman brings his average back over .200, he will continue to be a favorite for NL ROY.
2. **Corbin Carroll (ARZ LF)** \- Carroll has been in a slump, having two hits in his last 26 at-bats. Carroll started the season strong leading in almost all batting categories. Just as he was finding power in his swing,  Carroll has only hit for .186/.345/.372 in the last 15 days. But Carrolls strong start to the season has helped him remain a frontrunner for ROY. Carroll remains above average in every batting metric and has provided stellar defense in left field. This year Carroll has already accumulated 1.4 offensive WAR, which is  the most among all qualified NL rookies. Carroll will look to solidify the Diamondbacks outfield with Domingo Fletcher for years to come.
3. **Spenser Steer (CIN 3B/1B)** \- See my blurb above.
4. **Kendai Senga (NYM P) -**  See my blurb above.
5. **Blake Sabol (SF C) -**  On the year, Sabol has slashed .277/.333/.468 from the catcher position. With 3 doubles and five homes on 26 hits, Sabol is providing the Giants a consistent bat at the bottom of their lineup. Sabol has been below average in blocks, caught stealing, and framing metrics. He also ranks in the 1% percentile in whiff rate and strikeout rate, struggling to make contact with primarily breaking balls. Sabol currently has a 38% strikeout rate whiffing on 50% of breaking balls and 56% on offspeed pitches.

The stats I used for this analysis were prior to any games on Friday May 19th. If you want to see all the rookies I reviewed and their stats as of me writing this I have attached a [google sheet link here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMB-Eu4fowNgdKSRHoBorhtCOKr8KaTx3kYXfcUvZvc/edit?usp=sharing). I am primarily a Chicago Cubs fan so you will likely know more about your team than me, so I apologize if I may have overlooked or underlooked anything.","baseball",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13mklnj/rookie_biweekly_analysis_4/"
"2023-07-14",1689356551,"Truist Parks Day/Night Park Factor Splits","On the surface, Truist Park looks like a masterclass of balanced park design, with its perfect 100 park factor. Overall, it doesnt favor offense or defense. Split it between day games and night games, though, and something strange emerges. At night, the park factor jumps to 102, making it the 10th friendliest hitters park in baseball. During the day, the park factor is 94, the second friendliest pitchers park in baseball for day games besides Seattle. Its by far the biggest jump in baseball, and I dont understand it at all. 

My first thought was that theres something to do with the lighting of the park. Truist is angled strangely for a ballpark, with home plate pointing in a SSE direction. The only other outdoor parks angled that way are CWS and DET, and neither have any split at all. Also, Ks and BBs stay pretty constant between day and night. 

My second thought is related to weather. Atlanta is one of the hottest and humidest cities that hosts a team, and humidity cycles over the course of the day, with the lowest humidity occurring at midday. Heat and humidity both make the ball travel further, but its possible that humidity has a much more profound effect than heat. If so, the cool humid evening would be more conducive to offense than the hot, (relatively) dry daytime. 

It *has* to be something to do with the behavior of balls in play, but it just doesnt really seem to add up. Anybody have any ideas?","baseball",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/14zmz8f/truist_parks_daynight_park_factor_splits/"

Guardians (9-7) at Nationals (5-11)  Final: Nationals defeat Guardians 7-6

After a 1-2-3 inning from Patrick Corbin in the top of the 1st, Shane Bieber quickly ran into trouble in the first as Lane Thomas led off the bottom of the frame with a double down the left field line. He was quickly driven in by Jeiemer Candelario to put the Nats on top 1-0 with one out in the bottom of the first. Thomas later came up in the bottom of the second, hitting a double to right center to drive in Stone Garrett who stayed hot going 2-4 on the day. The Guardians struck back in the next half putting up four runs after hits from Zunino, Brennan, Kwan, and Bell. Following this, Candelario led off the bottom of the 3rd with a homerun to right which would be the last of the scoring until the 7th. Bieber finished the day with 6 IP, 4K and 3ER. Corbin was pulled after 6 innings as well, allowing 4 runs, 2 earned and fanning 4 as well. The Guardians added 2 more in the 7th with Kwan driving in Brennan for the second time of the day off of Hobie Harris. Luis Garcia put the score at 6-5 Guardians after a lefty-lefty homer off of Tim Herrin. The Nationals took the lead in the bottom of the 8th with RBIs from Thomas and Meneses while Kyle Finnegan closed the door, earning the save. 

Nationals POTG: Jeimer Candelario - 4/5, 2 RBI, 2 R, HR (3)

Guardians POTG:  Steven Kwan - 2/5, 2 RBI, R, SB (5)

Angels (7-8) at Red Sox (8-8)  Final: Red Sox defeat Angels 2-1

Ried Detmers gets strapped with a difficult loss, going 6.1 innings only giving up 2 on Justin Turners first home run as a Red Sock. Detmers punched out 7 and only allowed 1 free pass, inducing 2 double plays as well. His mound opponent Garrrett Whitlock was even more stingy however, allowing only 3 hits and 1 run over 7 innings. The lone run from the Angels came after an Anthony Rendon double followed by Brandon Drury RBI single in the 2nd. Ryan Brasier picked up the save to wrap up this pitching duel.

Angels POTG: Ried Detmers - 6.1 IP, 2 ER, 7K

Red Sox POTG: Garrett Whitlock - 7 IP, 5 K, 1 ER, 3 H, W

&amp;#x200B;

Twins (10-6) at Yankees (10-6)  Final: Yankees defeat Twins 2-0 

Another pitchers duel in the Bronx. Gerrit Cole dealt, going the distance, tossing a shutout with 10 Ks and only giving up 2 hits. Cole wracked up the punchouts somewhat efficiently as well, finishing the game with only 109 pitches. This drops his ERA on the season to 0.95 through 4 starts. Pablo Lopez made the start for the Twins and was handed the loss giving up 2 runs on 7 hits over 6 innings. Lopez did tally 7 Ks however, giving him the edge over Cole for the MLB lead in strikeouts at 33 compared to Coles 32. DJ LeMahieu was the lone offensive success in this game as he went 2-4 with a solo homer in the 6th and a single to drive in Aaron Judge in the 3rd. 

Yankees POTG: Gerrit Cole - 9 IP, 10K, 0 ER, 2 H, W

Twins POTG: Pablo Lopez - 6 IP, 7K, 2 ER, 7 H

Rays (14-2) at Blue Jays (10-6)  Final: Rays defeat Blue Jays 8-1

The Rays get back to their winning ways as they tag Alek Manoah for 7 earned over 4.2 innings. Manoah had a full on blow up start, walking 4 and surrendering 9 hits in less than 5 innings. The Rays loaded the bases in the first and put up 3 runs before their first 3 outs and scored an additional 4 runs in the 5th inning with an RBI double from Josh Lowe and a 3 run homer from Christian Bethancourt. The Blue Jays got their lone run in the first as Vlad Jr. singled home George Springer. Shane McClanahan went a solid 6 innings, striking out 6 and only giving up the one run. The Rays bullpen, while not as dominant as they typically are, still got the job done providing 3 shutout innings to wrap up the series. 

Rays POTG: Josh Lowe - 2/5, 3 RBI, 2B, R, SB (2) 

Blue Jays POTG: Trevor Richards - 2 IP, 3K, 0 ER

Phillies (6-10) at Reds (6-9)  Final: Phillies defeat Reds 14-3

The Phils pummeled Reds starter Luis Cessa for 11 runs in 3+ innings including a 9 run top of the first which started with a Bryson Stott leadoff homer. The inning included 7 more hits after Stotts and had a pair of walks as well. Trea Turner managed to leg out two infield singles in this inning alone. The rest of the game from the Phillies perspective was full of just scraping together runs based on poor defensive play with a Realmuto solo shot inserted in there as well. Despite Nola not having the best of starts, he acquired his first win of the year due to the flurry of runs, going 6 innings with 3 runs (2 earned) and striking out 4. This game was all Philly from the first batter on. 

Reds POTG: Spencer Steer - 2/3, R, BB

Phillies POTG: Trea Turner - 3/3, 3 R, RBI, 2 BB

&amp;#x200B;

Diamondbacks (9-7) at Marlins (8-8)  Finals: Diamondbacks defeat Marlins 5-0 

The matchup of aces as Zac Gallen faced off against 2022 NL Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara. Gallen continues after his great start against the Brewers going 6.2 scoreless and tallying another 7 punchouts to put him in the lead for the NL. Gallen was perfect through 4.1 until surrendering a single to Bryan De La Cruz, while Alcanatara surrendered a run as Alek Thomas drove in Corbin Carroll with an RBI single in the 2nd. All was quiet as the two righties went back and forth until the top of the 6th, where Alcantara made an error to start the unraveling of his quality outing. A pair of hits followed in the inning before Carroll took Alcantara deep to center for his 4th longball of the year to put the snakes up 5. The rest of the game was quiet on both ends as each bullpen shut the opposition down. 

Diamondbacks POTG: Zac Gallen - 6.2 IP, 2 H, 0 BB, 0 ER, 7K, W 

Marlins POTG: George Soriano - 3 IP, 1 H, 0 BB, 0 ER, 2K

Braves (12-4) at Royals (4-12)  Final: Braves defeat Royals 5-4

Kyle Wright went a solid 5.2 with 6 Ks, giving up 2 earned in his start. Grienke allowed 4 runs to cross in his 6 innings of work, also collecting 6 Ks. Vinnie Paquantino was the main cog in the Royals offense as he picked up a pair of RBIs on a 2 run, game tying blast in the 7th, also working a walk. Franmil Reyes also had a nice day at the dish going 2/4 with an RBI as well. On the Braves side, Ozzie Albies and Matt Olson were the main forces as Ozzie went 2/4 with a long ball and Olson hit a 2 RBI triple in the 3rd. Ronald Acuna picked up his 7th steal of the year and Vaughn Grissom came up clutch putting the Braves ahead in the top of the 9th driving in Albies with an infield single. AJ Minter struck out Bobby Witt to end the series and secure the save.

Braves POTG: Ozzie Albies - 2/4, 2 R, RBI, HR (3) 

Royals POTG: Vinnie Pasquantino - 1/3, R, 2 RBI, HR (3), BB

&amp;#x200B;

Orioles (9-7) at White Sox (6-10)  Final: Orioles defeat White Sox 8-4

The White Sox continue to disappoint, dropping game number 10 on the young season and allowing 8 unanswered runs despite putting up 4 in their first inning at the plate. This 4 run bottom of the first came courtesy of a Gavin Sheets 3 run homer to right and Jake Burgers 4th round tripper of the year. Dylan Cease had a rocky start as he walked 5, allowed 6 hits, and 4 runs (2 earned) in 6 innings. Cedric Mullins was the main source of fire power for the O's, driving in 4 on 3 hits including a 2 RBI triple in the 4th. Jorge Mateo stole his 8th base to tie Mullins for the AL lead in the category. Grayson Rodriguez was solid after making it out of the first inning, allowing no more runs and King 8 over 5 innings. 

Orioles POTG: Cedric Mullins - 3/5, 4 RBI, BB, 3B

White Sox POTG: Gavin Sheets - 2/4, 3 RBI, R, HR (1)

Pirates (9-7) at Cardinals (7-9)  Final: Cardinals defeat Pirates 5-4

St. Louis fans got to witness free baseball as the Cards walked off the Pirates in 10 innings. The red birds put up 3 runs on Mitch Keller over his 6 innings, coming from a Wilson Contreras RBI single in the 1st and a 6th inning 2-run homer from Lars Nootbaar. The Pirates themselves tagged Miles Mikolas for 3 runs in 5.2, scrapping a run in the first, second, and 6th innings. The game would be held at 3 as St. Louis relievers Pallante, Thompson and Gallegos were all steadfast against the Pittsburgh offense. Despite the Pirates being able to plate the extra-innings runner in the top of the 10th to make it 4-3, the Cardinals got an RBI double from Nolan Gorman to tie the game, and a walk off single from Tommy Edman to finish the contest. 

Cardinals POTG: Lars Nootbaar - 1/2, R 2 RBI, HR (1), 3 BB

Pirates POTG: Jack Suwinski - 2/3, R

&amp;#x200B;

Mets (10-6) at As (3-13)  Final: Mets defeat As 4-3

Another extra-inning affair wrapped up in Oakland after the As were unable to answer the Mets scoring in the top of the 10th due to a Francisco Lindor bases-loaded walk. The game from the Mets perspective was one of solo shots, one each from Tommy Pham (2), Lindor (4), and Pete Alonso (8) in the 2nd, 6th, and 9th respectively. JP Sears did a fine job keeping Oakland in the ball game, only allowing 4 hits over 6 innings, but a blown save by Danny Jimenez led to their demise. Jose Butto only allowed 1 run in his second big league start, as John Curtiss gave up 2 in an inning of relief. The As got their runs from Esteury Ruiz RBI single in the 5th and a 2 run double from Shea Langeliers in the 8th. 

Mets POTG: Jose Butto - 5 IP, 1 ER, 2K, 4 BB 

As POTG: Shea Langeliers - 2/4, 2 RBI, 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Rockies (5-11) at Mariners (8-8)  Final: Mariners defeat Rockies 1-0 

This was a master class on the mound. Luis Castillo shined, taking a perfect game into the 7th inning finishing with 9 Ks in 7 innings while only allowing 2 hits and walking none. His ERA on the season drops to 0.73, 4th in the MLB. Noah Davis made his first start of his young career and dazzled as well, going 5 strong, shutout innings while fanning 5. Dinelson Lamet relieved Davis and surrendered the only run of the contest on a Jarred Kelenic RBI single in the 6th. Kelenic also made a fabulous catch, diving to his left to end the 8th with a runner on second to keep the shutout alive. 

Mariners POTG: Luis Castillo - 7 IP, 2 H, 0 BB, 9 K, W

Rockies POTG: Noah Davis - 5 IP, 3 H, 3 BB, 5K

&amp;#x200B;

Cubs (8-6) at Dodgers (8-8)  Final: Cubs defeat Dodgers 3-2

Cody Bellingers homecoming series was a success for the former MVP. His Cubs took the series 2-1 with a win in the final game of the set. While Belli didnt play quite up to his former level, he did have a hit in each game, including a home run in this contest, while also taking away a round-tripper from Jason Heyward in center on Saturday. Drew Smyly had a great start allowing only one run in 5.2 innings, enough to out duel Julio Urias, who gave up 2. Patrick Wisdom homered not only in this game, but in every game in the series. Brad Boxberger earned the save as he finished the game for the Cubs. 

Cubs POTG: Patrick Wisdom - 2/4, R, RBI, HR (6)

Dodgers POTG: Mookie Betts - 3/4, RBI, BB, 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Rangers (9-6) at Houston (7-9)  Final: Rangers defeat Astros 9-1

The scoring didnt begin until late but once it did, it came in bunches for the Rangers. A Marcus Semien grand slam topped off a 6 run 7th, pinning 5 runs (only 1 earned) to Framber Valdez. The Astros were kept quiet by Andrew Heaney and the Rangers bullpen, getting only one run in the 7th. Jonah Heim and Leody Taveras had a pair of RBIs each as well for Texas. 

Rangers POTG: Marcus Semien - 2/5, R, 4 RBI, HR (2)

Astros POTG: Jeremy Pena - 1/3, 2B, R, 3 SB (4)

&amp;#x200B;

Brewers (11-5) at Padres (8-9)  Final: Brewers defeat Padres 1-0 

Pitching was the focus of this game, as the two starters (Wade Miley and Yu Darvish) went a combined 14 innings with 20 Ks. Both hurlers allowed 4 hits but Miley got the win due to Garrett Mitchell manufacturing a run on a bunt single, balk, stolen base, and sac fly from Brian Anderson. The Padres didnt go down without a contest however, loading the bases in the bottom of the 9th against Devin Williams after a Soto walk, Ha-seong Kim single, and Austin Nola walk. Williams caught Trent Grisham watching a fastball to end the game in nail biting fashion. 

Brewers POTG: Wade Miley - 7 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 8K, 0 BB, W

Padres POTG: Yu Darvish - 7 IP, 4 H, 1 ER, 12 K

&amp;#x200B;

Game to watch tomorrow:

Blue Jays at Astros: Kevin Gausman is slotted to match up against Cristian Javier, as the Astors look to turn their 7-9 record around. The Blue Jays are coming off of ending the Rays 13 game winning streak and taking 2 of 3 in the series and look to keep that momentum rolling. The Blue Jays have the top 3 spots in batting average as Matt Chapman sits at a .421 clip, Vlad jr. is at .387 and Bo Bichette is at .375. Yordan Alvarez is baseballs leading run producer with 20 RBIs already.","baseball",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12pw7ao/summary_of_41623/"

Long-time lurker first time poster here, who finally got around to reading the book behind the Brat Pitt mega blockbuster about Billy Beane's Oakland A's.

I'm approx. three chapters into the bestseller, and find it's slanted to the point of being borderline unreadable. Has anyone else had this experience?

Hindsight has disproven legitimately 50%&lt; of the author's opening takes.

\- **Jeremy Bonderman** being drafted late in the 1st Round of the '01 Draft was apparently such egregious a selection that Billy smashed a chair in front of ownership. Gasp! Bonderman went on to a 10-year major league career, and had the 8th-highest war of any first-round selection that year despite going at No. 26.

\- **JP Ricciardi**, Toronto's hot new GM in 2001, extols the virtues of Billy  ""he's so much better than any other general manager""  as he embarks on a nine-year tenure where the Jays did quite literally nothing of value and wasted Roy Halladay's prime. Great way to end the foreword.

\- The author, while rightly pointing out the A's financial struggles and inability to compete with BOS/NYY to retain its pending FAs, completely neglects the fact that Hudson/Zito/Mulder  *all drafted in the Grady Fuson era!*  combined to win 56 games in 2001. Kind of a large plot point to just gloss over.

Just curious if others have had a similar experience; every time a player's mentioned I immediately pull up their BBref, and it seems like the entire book has aged, uh, poorly.","baseball",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/z72lf1/hotcold_take_moneyball_is_tough_to_get_through/"

"2023-04-21",1682035395,"Daily Rundown for 4/19/23","Rays (15-3) at Reds (7-10)  Final: Rays defeat Reds 8-0

The Rays got out to a very quick start, scoring 6 in the first before making their second out. Yandy Diaz kicked things off with a liner over the left field wall for his 6th of the year. Isaac Paredes, Josh Lowe, and Manuel Margot all drove in runs and the 1st was topped off when Margot scored on a balk. Taylor Walls and Brandon Lowe snagged an RBI each later in the game to finish off the Rays scoring. Drew Rasmussen only went 5 innings, but they were quality, giving up no runs on 3 hits, striking out 7.

Rays POTG: Yandy Diaz - 2/4, R, RBI, BB, HR (6) 

Reds POTG: Reiver Sanmartin - 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB

Guardians (9-9) at Tigers (7-9)  Final: Guardians defeat Tigers 3-2

Both Cal Quantrill and Spencer Turnbull had solid outings, both exchanging 0s until the 6th. During the Guardians half of the frame however, Turnbull made a mistake to Jose Ramirez who made him pay with a homer to right. The Guardians bullpen was shaky, as Trevor Stephan got taken deep by Spencer Torkelson and James Karinchak gave up a pinch-hit bomb to Zach McKinstry. Emmanuel Clase got the save despite giving up 2 hits in the 9th. 

Guardians POTG: Cal Quantrill - 6 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 4 K, W

Tigers POTG: Spencer Torkelson - 2/3, R, RBI, HR (2), 2B, BB 

&amp;#x200B;

Giants (5-11) at Marlins (10-8)  Final: Giants defeat Marlins 5-2 in 11 innings

Collectively, the Marlins pitching staff performed well, giving up only 1 run on 4 hits in the first 10 innings. The only problem for Miami was that the Giants staff allowed only 1 to cross the plate in that time frame as well. With both teams unable to plate the extra inning runner in the 10th, we moved to the 11th knotted at 1-1. Then the fun started, at least for San Fran. Michael Conforto blasted a 2-run shot over the wall in center and Mike Yastrzemski did the same a couple batters later. The fish were able to score one on a Jon Berti double in the bottom half, but ultimately came up short. 

Giants POTG: Michael Conforto - 1/2, R, 2 RBI, HR (4) 

Marlins POTG: Tanner Scott - 1.2 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 2 K

&amp;#x200B;

Diamondbacks (11-7) at Cardinals (7-11)  Final: Cardinals defeat Diamondbacks 14-5

The Cardinals were able to nab at least one game in this 3 game set with an offensive outburst against Madison Bumgarner and Peter Solomon. Despite the widespread production from the St. Louis lineup, Tommy Edman managed to stand out, finishing a single shy of the cycle and racking up 5 RBIs in the process. Wilson Contreras also stayed hot, going 2/3 with an RBI and a pair of walks. Pavin Smith and Alek Thomas went yard for the Diamondbacks and Corbin Carroll managed to hit 2 doubles with a pair of walks while swiping bag number 7. 

Cardinal POTG: Tommy Edman - 3/4, 3 R, 5 RBI, HR (2), 3B, 2B, BB

Diamondbacks POTG: Pavin Smith - 2/3, 2 R, RBI, HR (2) , BB

&amp;#x200B;

Phillies (7-11) at White Sox (7-11)  Final: Phillies defeat the White Sox 5-2

Most of this games action happened towards the front end with no runs being scored on either side after 3 and a half innings. Trea Turner hit his first Phillie long ball off of Mike Clevinger in the first, but Chicago quickly responded with a 2-run homer off the bat of Andrew Vaughn. From then on, it was all Philadelphia. Brandon Marsh hit his 3rd bomb of the year in the 2nd, Nick Castellanos drove in Turner with a single in the 3rd, then both Bryson Stott and Trae Turner had RBI doubles in the 4th. Gregory Santos did well in relief for the White Sox, allowing nothing while striking out 4 in 2 innings. Jose Alvarado saved the game but surprisingly struck out no one. 

Phillies POTG: Trea Turner - 3/5, 2 R, 2 RBI, HR (1), 2B, SB (4) 

White Sox POTG: Andrew Vaughn - 2/4, R, 2 RBI, HR (1)

Rangers (11-6) at Royals (4-14)  Final: Rangers defeat Royals 12-3

The Rangers scattered runs all throughout the game, led by Marcus Semien, Jonah Heim, and Leody Taveras, all with multiple hits and multiple RBIs. Brady Singer got tagged with 5 earned runs and the loss as Martin Perez got the win despite a mediocre start, allowing 3 earned in 5.2. Vinny Pasquantino and Franmil Reyes were the only Royals with multiple hits and Bobby Witt hit the only homer for the home team. 

Rangers POTG: Jonah Heim - 2/4, 3 R, 3 RBI, HR (3), BB

Royals POTG: Franmil Reyes - 2/3, RBI 

&amp;#x200B;

Mets (11-7) at Dodgers (9-9)  Final: Mets defeat Dodgers 5-3

As I alluded to yesterday, this game might have some drama due to both starters facing their former teams. While there was drama, this was not the source of it. Max Scherzer was tossed during his foreign substance check following the 3rd, insisting that he used nothing but sweat and rosin. But back to the actual baseball. Brandon Nimmo powered New York past the Dodgers, going 5/5 with a 431 foot 2-run blast. Noah Syndergaard had a nice outing, only allowing the two runs to Nimmo over 6. David Peralta collected 2 RBIs including one in the 9th but it wasnt enough as Mark Canha doubled home two runs in the top of the 9th, giving Adam Ottovino a wide enough margin to get a save.

Mets POTG: Brandon Nimmo - 5/5, 2 R, 2 RBI, HR (1) 

Dodgers POTG: 1/3, R, 2 RBI, HR (1) 

&amp;#x200B;

Pirates (11-7) at Rockies (5-13)  Final: Pirates defeat Rockies 14-3

With the same score as Mondays game, the Pirates once again pummeled the Rockies, sending Colorado to their 8th loss in a row. Austin Gomber gave up 9 runs in 2 innings and Jose Oviedo dealt, allowing 1 run over 6. Ryan McMahon got 3 hits but otherwise it was all Pittsburgh up and down the lineup. 

Pirates POTG: Andrew McCutchen - 2/5, 2 R, 2 RBI, HR (4), 2B

Rockies POTG: Ryan McMahon - 3/5, RBI, 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Cubs (10-6) at As (3-15)   Final: Cubs defeat As 12-2

Another double digit win by an NL Central team here. The Cubs jumped on the As bullpen for 10 runs, 5 of which came in the 9th. Nico Hoerner had 3 hits and Nick Madrigal, Patrick Wisdom, and Luis Torrens all had 2 RBIs. Justin Steele was dominant, throwing 6 innings of one run ball. Eric Hosmer hit the only homer of the day.

Cubs POTG: Ian Happ - 2/4, 2 R, RBI, BB 2 2B

As POTG: Jordan Diaz - 1/2, RBI, 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Brewers (13-5) at Mariners (8-10)  Final: Brewers defeat Mariners 5-3

The Brewers swept the series due to a 5 run 7th inning, highlighted by Brice Turangs 2 RBI single to give Milwaukee the lead. Turang made his fair contribution on defense as well, making two difficult plays. Tellez followed Turang with a single to cash in another 2 runs and give the Brewers all they would need. The Mariners made it tough however, scoring one in the 9th and also having the bases loaded but Matt Bush was able to escape with a save. Lefties Eric Lauer and Marco Gonzalez pitched well for their teams as Julio Rodriguez lead the charge for Seattle, going 2/3 with a pair of RBIs and a long ball. 

Brewers POTG: Eric Lauer - 7.1 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 4 K, W

Mariners POTG: Marco gonzalez - 6 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 9 K

&amp;#x200B;

Braves (14-4) at Padres (8-11)  Final: Padres defeat Braves 1-0

The Padres were able to snap Atlantas 8 game win streak due to a brilliant outing from Nick Martinez. Martinez gave San Diego 7 shutout innings, only allowing 3 hits. The lone run in the game came in the 4th when Juan Soto took Charlie Morton deep, who had a good start in his own regard. However, the Braves offense could not get anything going. Josh Hader closed the door and earns a save. 

Padres POTG: Nick Martinez - 7 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 6 K, W 

Braves POTG: Charlie Morton - 6 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 5 K

&amp;#x200B;

Angels (9-8) at Yankees (10-7)  Final: Yankees defeat Angels 3-2 in 10 innings

The Yankees went 8 frames of putting up no runs after they dropped 2 in the first when Aaron Judge took Griffin Canning deep for his 6th of the year. Jhony Brito delivered a short, yet effective start as he only allowed one run in 4.1 innings. The Angels were able to tie the game with RBIs from Taylor Ward and Gio Urshella but allowed a sac fly to Gleyber Torres after coming up empty in the top of the 10th. 

Yankees POTG: 1/3, 2 RBI, HR (6), 2 BB

Angels POTG: Zach Neto - 2/3 

&amp;#x200B;

Orioles (10-7) at Nationals (5-12)  Final: Orioles defeat Nationals 4-0

Kyle Bradish and the Orioles pen shut out the Nationals for the second consecutive game as the Orioles passed the Blue Jays for the 3rd spot in the AL East. As mentioned, Bradish had a nice game, giving up nothing in 6 innings while punching out 6 Nats. Mackenzie Gore allowed 3 runs over 6, walking Adley Rutschman with the bases loaded in the 3rd and giving up a lefty-lefty 2-run long ball to Adam Frazier in the 4th. Otherwise, an uneventful game. 

Orioles POTG: Kyle Bradish - 6 IP, 5 H, 6 K, W

Nationals POTG: Keibert Ruiz - 3/4

&amp;#x200B;

Twins (10-7) at Red Sox (9-9)  Final: Twins defeat Red Sox 10-4

The Twins stacked up the runs, getting bombs from Jose Miranda, Edouard Julien, and Joey Gallo. Julien had 2 more hits in addition to his 418 foot shot as Corey Kluber struggled, allowing 7 runs, all earned. Joe Ryan was serviceable, giving 6 innings allowing 3 runs. Brent Headrick got the 3 inning save, giving up a run of his own. Enrique Hernandez put one over the green monster but other than that, a rather uneventful offensive showing for the Sox. 

Twins POTG: Edouard Julien - 3/4, 2 R, 2 RBI, HR (2) 

Red Sox POTG: Enrique Hernandez - 2/3, 2 R, RBI, HR (3), BB

&amp;#x200B;

Blue Jays (11-7) at Astros (8-10)  Final: Astros defeat Blue Jays 8-1

The Astros got a stellar performance from Luis Garcia as Jose Abreu and Jeremy Pena led the charge on offense. Garcia carved up the Blue Jays to the tune of 9 Ks over 7 scoreless innings. Whit Merrifield got half of Torontos 4 hits and drove in their lone run as well. Abreu got a pair of RBIs on a pair of singles and Jeremy Pena only had one hit, but made it count as it was a 3-run round-tripper to put Houston up 7 in the 8th. 

Astros POTG: Luis Garcia - 7 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 9 K, W

Blue Jays POTG: Whit Merrifield - 2/3, 2B, RBI

Game to watch  Angels at Yankees

While I am cheating a bit because of the late post, I wrote this section before the game so... oh well. 

In a day of few games, it is rather slim pickings. So why not have some fun a keep an eye on Nestor Cortes. Cortes is one of the best personalities in baseball and had a breakout year last season. His mound opponent Patrick Sandoval is no slouch either, coming in to the game with a 1.23 ERA. Not to mention this game contains arguably the top three favorites to take home AL MVP in Shohei Ohtani, Mike Trout, and Aaron Judge.","baseball",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12tjuwg/daily_rundown_for_41923/"

Hello and I hope everyone had happy holidays! Sorry for the new account but I sadly lost access to my old one due to forgetting my password :(. Anyways today we will begin doing the final division that is NL East Founding Members(no actually)(NEFM) starting with the Phillies!

Phillies:

**Titles:0**

The Phillies made the playoffs 3 years in a row to start the save, collecting their first of 11 NEFM titles in 2022 between 2 WC appearances but failed to get past the NLDS1 in all 3 years. Following 2023 they would fail to reach the playoffs 7 years in a row until 2031 making the playoffs despite being last in their division but lost in the first round. They would miss the playoffs the following year but would win the division in 2033 but lose in the second round, and would miss the playoffs in 2034. 2034 would be the last time they would miss the playoffs for the rest of the save collecting 6 straight NEFM titles plus 4 more before the end of the save, producing some very good teams along the way. Despite their dominance of the division they made the NLCS 3 times and only made 1 WS but ran into the red hot Yankees whose single playoff loss came against them. Following the WS heartbreak the Phillies would make NLCS 5 times over the next 6 years only failing to reach it in 2043. They failed to win any, losing 3 Game 7s. They retired Bryce Harper's number in 2032. 

Nationals

**Titles:2**

Nationals failed to reach the playoffs for the first 6 years until they won their first of 5 NEFM  titles in 2028 but lost in the second round. The following year they would once again win the division this time making the WS, winning in 5 against the Dodgers. They would fail to win the division the following year making the playoffs as a WC team but lost in the second round. They would win the division in 2030 with 109 wins, winning in 7 against the Yankees. They would have another 100+ win season the following year but lost in the NLCS in 7. They won the NEFM for the final time in 2032 but lost in the second round. They would make the playoffs the following 2 years as WC teams but did not make it past the second round. Following the NLDS2 loss in 2034 they would embark on a 11 year drought ending it in 2046, despite winning 96 games they did not win the division and lost in the second round. They retired Max Scherzer's number in 2023 and Juan Sotos number in 2038.  

Cubs

**Titles:0**

The Cubs did not make the playoffs until 2026 winning their first of 4 NEFM titles losing in the second round. They would make it in over the next 2 years as WC teams but did not make it out of the second round in either year. They would make it back to the playoffs again as a WC team in 2031 but once again lose in the second round. After the NLDS2 they would fail to reach the playoffs for the next 8 years. In 2041 they won the division ending the drought but lost in the second round. They would make the playoffs as a WC team in 2042 but lose in the first round. They would win the division in 2043 finally making it to the NLCS winning it but would go on to lose Game 7 of the WS against the Pirates. They would improve, winning 103 games and again winning the division but would tragically lose another game 7 in the WS this time against the Yankees. They missed the playoffs the following year but would make it back in 2046 as a 95 win WC team but lost in the first round. No new numbers were retired.

Mets

**Titles:1** 

Mets won the first ever NEFM title and also won their only WS in 5 against the Angels in 2021. After missing the playoffs in 2022 and losing Degrom permanently to injury they would take 3 straight NEFM titles but only made it to the NLCS once and lost. After missing the playoffs the following 2 years they would make the playoffs 5 times in a row collecting another NEFM title. They would make another WS in 2029 but would lose in 7 against the Mariners. Following this they would fail to make it out of the first round as WC teams over the next 3 years.  After missing the playoffs in 2033 they would win their final NEFM title in 2034 winning a total of 6 but were swept in the NLCS. They would make it in as a WC team the following year but lose in the first round starting a 4 year drought. They would make the playoffs one final time in 2040 as a WC team but lose in the second round. After the 2040 season the Mets would have 1 more season above 70 wins in 2041 before completely imploding, nearly having 5 straight 100 loss seasons and never winning more than 65 games a year. Noah Syndergaard's number was retired in 2032 and Francisco Lindors in 2034.

"2023-09-18",1695056434,"Not pro/MLB: saw one of ""those"" injuries IRL yesterday","I played baseball from the age of 10 through college, and have been playing in a men's league for the last 10 years or so...worst thing I ever saw IRL was a freak collision at first base, bunt play, 2B covering, throw led him into the runner, dislocated elbow. That was bad but not really in that unsettling sense.

I've seen TWO - of very different type - in just the last few months.

First, a few months ago, had a very scary thing happen on the field. Perfectly fit, healthy 28 y/o guy playing left field, dives for a sinking fly ball. Lands kinda hard, as opposed to sliding. He stays down and I thought the wind got knocked out of him. He gets up in a few minutes and seems fine. Inning ends. Next inning, he comes back out, again, seems fine. Mid-inning, he just starts walking off the field toward the dugout. No urgency, just...walking. It was hot-ish, but not heat-stroke hot, but everyone kinda assumes he may need water or cooling down. He gets to the bench and sits down, and he looks very dazed, glassy eyes, kinda staring off. Their catcher is a paramedic and before long, he says, ""hey, someone call 911."" His words are still hanging in the air when his mate has a full gran mal seizure. Eyes roll back in his head, everything. It was terrifying. Turns out, whether the ball hit him on that missed dive, or he smacked his head on the ground, he had a skull fracture and a brain bleed. Last I heard, he was doing very well, didn't need surgery, but not sure what his future looks like.

Ok, now the actual baseball one: we're not a big league, so we see a lot of the same guys, and over the years, I've definitely developed friendships, just guys I really respect and have fun playing against. One of those guys was the opponent yesterday. Just an inning or two before, he was on third (I play SS) and we said hi and shook hands. He's just a really good dude.

He comes in to pitch like 4th or 5th, I think. First batter sends one straight back at him and he Neo-Matrix catches this thing. Unreal play. I think he goes two more batters, so the third guy he faces...the dreaded ""POP"" noise. Pitch goes to the backstop and he goes to the ground, screaming. He's on his back and his arm is just out to the side. I heard someone say ""his arm is just laying there, I can't look,"" and I'm expecting the worst. I don't do great with that stuff. BUT...as this fall league is actually all the way down to 18+, my son is playing with me and he's an EMT (as is his g/f, who came to the game), so I feel like I have to go out and at least do what I can to support.

Turns out, no deformation or anything, no visible damage at all, but he is in obvious, severe pain. They get his shirt cut off him and fashion a makeshift sling, get his arm supported and get him up and off the field. The pain seemed to finally settle down...well, down from excruciating, I'm sure his toughness was a factor.

My son's asking him if he thinks it's shoulder or elbow, we're all thinking soft tissue, rotator, labrum, UCL, all that. He's saying ""bicep"" more than any other answer, so I figure that's generally that biceps tendon/labrum. I don't want to post pics, even though he shared them with our manager, of someone else's medical info (even though nothing is personally identifying on it), so I'll only describe it: turns out, he full blown fractured his humerus just above the elbow, a ""comminuted"" fracture, meaning broken into more than three pieces. We literally heard his bone crack. 

Turns out, he thinks on the ""Neo"" catch, he leaned on that arm for support and potentially did a slight fracture to it then (I guess it only just 'hurt a little' and he didn't think much of it, which is why he continued to pitch), and then the force of trying to throw a hard curve ball did the rest of the damage. Absolutely crazy, and I just felt so bad for the guy. When a grown man screams like that, you KNOW it hurts.

I think he's getting surgery today, I hope his future can still include baseball.

(P.S. Believe it or not, a spectator, SOMEHOW, snapped a pic of the moment it happened, too. Again, wish I could share, but it feels wrong. Not ""gory,"" but just, in retrospect, very unsettling).","baseball",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/16m0xz5/not_promlb_saw_one_of_those_injuries_irl_yesterday/"
"2023-01-18",1674086024,"2023 Team Summaries - Part 1: Washington Nationals","**Overall Assessment**

The 2023 Nationals are awful in pretty much every respect. There are some bad teams where if the owner stopped being cheap and was willing to make some moves things might turn around but this a team with more or no less no core to build around I imagine it will take 5 year minimum for the Nats to break .500 again.

Strengths: Keibert Ruiz is a pretty good catcher, the farm isnt terrible if you look below AA

Holes: Pretty much everything else, no stars, awful rotation, generally subpar lineup. Destined to lose 100 games.

**The Starters: (Based on Fangraph Projections)**

**Super-Stars** \- None

**Stars**  \- None

&amp;#x200B;

**Core Players** \- These are guys you can expect to be in the 2-4 WAR range and be above league average

**C Keibert Ruiz** \- Ruiz was an above average catcher last year with a 95 OPS+ and average traditional defense as a 23 year old rookie. His statcast suggests he was somewhat unlucky last season and these numbers could improve and as a 23 year old he is likely to get better with experience. Id put him at a 2-3 WAR estimate for next season as an above average but not remarkable catcher.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**  \- Guys with potential to be good but also a lot of potential to not be

**SS C.J Abrams -**  Abrams was a hot prospect with both a good glove and bat in the minors. His first year in the majors was rough with a 4th%  percentile OAA (although the eye test and sprint speed made him look better) and a 76 OPS+ were a bit underwhelming. Still as an elite prospect with a track record of success in AA or AAA Abrams could certainly be a good player going forward. Still im less optimistic then most next year. 

**SP Mackenzie Gore** \- Gores ceiling as a prospect was quite high. He dominanted the lower levels of the minors. His call up to the majors was shaky with below average numbers and not phenomenal stuff either. However Gore is young and I think his injuries may have masked some of his talent. Theres a chance that Gore could be transformed to a solid maybe even very good pitcher. Even in his current 4.50 ERA form hes better than most options the nationals have in an abysmal rotation.

**DH Joey Meneses** \- Menses was great last 1/2 season. He also was relatively solid hitter in AAA. There was no indication that his ceiling is anywhere near as high as his performance last year so I expect some regression but I think Menses could actually be a 2-3 WAR player and maybe the best hitter on the nationals next season. Theres not clear enough information though to really

**3B Jeimer Candelario** \- Candelario was bad in 2022 and he was bad all around but while hes always been a below average 3B he should good hitting upside in 2020 and 2021 and the overall terrible performance of the tigers make me think that it was perhaps a management/coaching issue and theres a possibility to turn Candelario into a 3 War player yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Squad Players** \- These are guys who arent going to be great but probably good enough to start on an average MLB team

**OF Lane Thomas** \- Thomas is a good squad player. Hes very average with a 1.6 WAR, 103 OPS+. I think his statcast suggests that hes really below average and will be an unremarkable 0-1 WAR player but hes relatively young and inexperienced so maybe he works a bit on his skills. At best though I think we get average from him at worst mediocre still Id expect Thomas to finish the season with at least 1 WAR which is more than I can say about most of the nationals teams.

**CL Kyle Finnegan -** A good reliever but certainly no ones idea of a great closer but is pretty decent with a 0.4 rWAA and 112 ERA+ last season. No complaints but not expecting him to carry the team.

**SP Trevor Williams -** Has below average stuff and has been a part-time SP and hasn't been a full-time SP since 2020 with light workloads as a backup option for the Mets but he's been pretty good in that role with a 120 ERA+ last season far more than can be said of the Nats other pitchers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unideal (Players with some skills but more downsides than upsides)**

**2B Luis Garcia -** Awful defensive 2B with an above average bat (102 OPS+) but too many holes to seem like much more than that is possible in the near future. Hes young so some potential for growth but Maybe 1 WAR next year optimistically.

**OF Corey Dickerson** \- I dont see much upside with Dickerson. Hes a platoon OF hovering around 100 OPS+. Hes getting older. Hes struggled with injuries. I think the Nats would be lucky to get more than a 1 WAR season out of him.

**CF Victor Robles** \- Robles is a defensive stud but he cant hit for his life and has had struggle with injuries. I expect he will end up in the 1-2 WAR range unless injured continuing his tradition of being a near elite CF and a terrible hitter. I see a lot of potential for major downside for him though with a pretty low ceiling so despite maybe a bit higher of a cieling than Garcia and Dickerson def unideal.

**SP Josiah Gray** \- Awful full debut season with the Nationals in 2022. Probably a poor-mans SP5 at best right now. Hes at least has averages stuff if he works a bit on placement. I think he will improve to being a bad but not horrendous pitcher. Upside is very low though at best we are talking 2 WAR and we could easily be taking 0.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Rest of the Bullpen -** Im not going to go through each pitcher individually since the Nats are so bad. I think their bullpen is merely bad not horrendous like their rotation. Finnegan is pretty good. Harvey is ok. The rest are varying degrees of mediocre but few are terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liabilities (Players who will probably be very bad**)

**1B Dominic Smith** \- Smith is reclamation project based largely on his performance in 2020. He was awful 2022 and I expect he will be again. I think hes a place holder for a mid-season AAA call-up

**SP Patrick Corbin** \- The worst full time pitcher in baseball. Awful for two years now almost surely will be awful again.

**SP Stephen Strasburg** \- Huge contract with a solid consensus building that he will never play another full season of baseball again.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bench**

**OF Stone Garrett, INF Ilderamo Vargas,** **OF Alex Call** \- Not a bad bench. Most of these players are kind of better half of AAA players and likely dont possess extraordinary upside but all of them could be a good threat for a 1-2 WAR season and not much worse than the nationals starters. I think the replacement national does not represent a major drop from the average national mostly because the bench is about average whereas the starters are very below average. Certainly if any of them get hot and one of the starters gets cold they can sub. Most of these guys will likely platoon.

**C Riley Adams** \- A bad backup catcher essentially a 0 at the plate pretty good defense kept him around 0 WAR. I think he will be replaced by Pineada sometime in the season

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential Minor Leaguer Replacements ready this season**

**3B Jake Alu** \- Alu wasnt a top prospect but he has hit consistently well in the minors and played defense excellently. The super high ceiling isnt there but with great flexibility and consistent performance along with weak competition I think hes more or less guaranteed to get a shot to start in the majors fairly quickly in the season.

**SP Cade Cavalli/ OF Robert Hassell III** \- Both prospects have relatively high ceilings. Neither of them performed well last year when promoted (Cavalli to MLB, Hassell to AA). I think a 2024 full season debut is more likely for both of them.

**C Israel Pineada -** Probably will make a decent-ish backup catcher. His bat was pretty good in AA. His glove needs a bit of work but he probably a better bet than Adams and could be an above average platoon.

**1B Wilson Garcia** \- Older more established minor leaguer with a decent bat in AA I see him as likely injury sub as a relatively ready to go player. I don't think he has the upside to be a full time MLB starter unlike Alu or Hassell III if he can make some adjustments.

**AAA SP -** All of the Nats options for injury replacement for an SP and their likely SP5 are terrible 5.00 ERA pitchers with Adon being the most likely solution. All of these pitchers are likely negative WAR.

Neither team was able to score until Anthony Volpe homered in the 8th to score 2. Danny Jansen would respond in the 9th with a 2-run homer of his own to tie the game at two, but DJ LeMahieu would come up with the bases loaded and single home the winning run to walk the game off for the Yankees.

At a chilly Target Field, Pablo Lopez struggled, giving up 5 runs in 4 innings against Washington. Joey Meneses hit an RBI single in the 1st and one in the 2nd to get off to a hot start in this one, going 4/6 on the day. CJ Abrams would grab 3 RBIs on a homer and Jeimer Candelario drove in a pair as well. Mason Thompson would get the win as Chad Kuhl would throw 96 pitches through 3.2, but only gave up 1 ER. Thompson threw 2.1 without giving up an earned run and striking out 4. On the Twins side, Byron Buxton went yard and Carlos Correa racked up a trio of base knocks.

Both the Dodgers and Cubs got somewhat shaky starts from their young right handers. Dustin May gave up 2 earned over 5.1 and Hayden Wesneski would allow 3 over 4.1. Both teams would get a run across in the first and then traded blows. James Outman once again hit a pair of homers after doing the same on Thursday (4/20), giving him 7 on the year. Max Muncy would also go deep twice, tying Pete Alonso for the league lead at 10. Nico Hoerner had a pair of hits, one of which was a 2-run longball, raising his average to .367 on the year.

Game one of Marlins (10-9) at Guardians (10-9)  Final: Marlins defeat Guardians 6-1

The Marlins grabbed RBIs from Yuli Gurriel and Jean Segura in the 2nd to jump out to a 2 run lead that they would never relinquish. Josh Bell would drive in Clevelands run with a double in the 4th before Miami would tack on 4 more. Bryan De La Cruz homered and Luis Arraez singled home 2 runs.

White Sox (7-13) at Rays (17-3)  Final: Rays defeat White Sox 4-3 in 10

Shane McClanahan got 32 whiffs from the White Sox in this start on only 88 pitches, which helped him rack up 10 strikeouts in 6 innings. He did give up a pair of long homers to Eloy Jiminez (434 ft) and Yasmani Grandal (428 ft), but this is all he would allow. Gavin Sheets would hit the 3rd solo homer for the White Sox in the 8th to tie the game at the time. Randy Arozarena drove in all 4 runs for the Rays: 2in the 1st with a homer, 1 in the 5th with a single, and the walk off in the 10th with a single. Dylan Cease struggled a bit allowing 3 runs to cross in 4 innings.

Rays POTG: Randy Arozarena - 3/5, R, 4 RBI, HR (5)

&amp;#x200B;

Logan Webb was finally able to dial in, getting his first win in start number 5. Webb gave San Fran 7 solid innings, allowing 2 on a Daniel Vogelbach double and Brandon Nimmo long ball. The Giants would get off to a good start, getting 4 in the 1st, 3 of which came from a homer by Brandon Crawford. Wilmer Flores would go deep later in the game and the Mets would attempt a comeback, getting a run in the 8th and 9th, but it would be too little too late. Edwin Uceta would keep the Giants quiet in 3 innings of relief after David Peterson gave up all 7.

Giants POTG: Logan Webb - 7 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 8 K, W

Mets POTG: Mark Canha - 2/3, 2 R, BB

Rich Hill struck out 7 in 5 innings and Yohan Ramirez and Duane Underwood Jr. would both give the Pirates 2 shutout innings in relief, with Underwood grabbing a save. Stuart Fairchild and Jose Barrero got 2 hits each for the Reds. The lone Cincy run would come from an error on a Fairchidl single in the 5th.

The Orioles move their win streak to 5 games as Kyle Gibson stays undefeated and grabs win number 4 on the young season. Gibson punched out 11 over 6.1, allowing just a single run. The Orioles got 4 runs of support for Gibson in the 3rd thanks to an RBI single from Adley Rutschman and bases-clearing double from Ramon Urias. James Mccan would put one over the wall in center for the last Baltimore run in the 4th. Zack McKinstry kept the Tigers from being shut out with a 410 ft bomb of his own in the 7th.

Orioles POTG: Kyle Gibson - 6.1 IP, 2 H, 1 ER, 11K, W

&amp;#x200B;

As (4-16) at Rangers (12-7)  Final: Rangers defeat As 18-3

As magical as the Rays start to the season has been, the As start has been just as cursed. The As have a -100 run differential already which is almost twice as bad as the Rockies who are then next worst at -54. The Rangers beat up on the As to the tune of 18 runs, but the main story of the game was Adolis Garcia. Garcia hit 3 2-run homers on top of a pair of doubles, giving him 16 total bases on the game. Garcia would tally 8 RBIs and scored 5 times himself. Aside from Garcia, it was a classic rout. Andrew Heaney was good and Ezequiel Duran went 2/2 with a homer of his own.

Rangers POTG: Adolis Garcia - 5/5, 5 R, 8 RBI, 3 HR (5,6,7), 2 2B

As POTG: Jesus Aguilar - 2/3, R, RBI, HR (2)

&amp;#x200B;

Red Sox at Brewers (11-10) at Brewers (14-6)  Final: Brewers defeat Red Sox 5-4

Rowdy Tellez has owned the Red Sox in his career, having the highest OPS ever against the team at 1.187 (with a min of 100 ABs). Tellez highlighted this with a 2-run homer in the 3rd to put the Brewers up 3-0 after a Brian Anderson RBI double. Wade Miley had another strong outing, but got tagged by Yu Chang for a 2-run homer of his own. Devers would put the Red Sox within one with another 2-run long ball. Yelich would double home a run and Rowdy would drive in another by grounding into a double play. Devin Williams would come on for the save.

Brewers POTG: Christian Yelich - 2/4, 2 R, RBI, 2B, SB (5)

Red Sox POTG: Rafael Devers - 2/4, R, 2 RBI, HR (8)

&amp;#x200B;

Astros (10-10) at Braves (14-6)  Final: Astros defeat Braves 6-3

The Astros take the 2nd game of the 3 game set to clinch the series win. Sean Murphy started the scoring with his 5th homer of the year in the 4th inning. Yordan Alvarez and Kyle Tucker would then put the Astros up 4-1 in the 6th with a 2-run homer each off of Kyle Wright. Ozzie Albies would put the Braves within 1 with another 2-run homer in the bottom of the 6th, but the Astros pulled away with RBI singles from Corey Julks and Jose Abreu in the 8th and 9th respectively. Bryan Abreu would strike out 2 in the 9th to get the save. Ronald Acuna Jr had a pair of hits, raising his average to .375 and stole 3 bases for number 9, 10 and 11 on the year.

Astros POTG: Yordan Alvarez - 1/5, R, 2 RBI, HR (6)

Braves POTG: Ozzie Albies - 2/4, R, 2 RBI, HR (5)

&amp;#x200B;

Padres (11-11) at Diamondbacks (12-9)  Final: Padres defeat Diamondbacks 5-3

Fernando Tatis announces his return after a quiet first game back by hitting a solo homer in the 1st inning off Merrill Kelly. Both starters went 5 innings, with Joe Musgrove giving up 3 and Merrill Kelly giving up 4. Christian Walker led the way for the snakes offense, going 2/3 with a 2-run homer. San Diego got production up and down their lineup and reclaimed the lead thanks to Ha-Seong Kims 2 RBI single in the 6th. Jake Cronenworth would tack on another with a single in the 8th and Josh Hader grabbed save number 7.

Padres POTG: Juan Soto - 2/4, 2 R

Diamondbacks POTG: Christian Walker - 2/3, R, 3 RBI, HR (3)

&amp;#x200B;

Royals (4-16) at Angels (10-10)  Final: Royals defeat Angels 11-8

In a game with many, many runs, the Royals broke LAs hearts with a 5 run top of the 9th to steal a win away. With a lot to cover, lets just touch on the highlights: Hunter Renfroe hit 2 solo homers, Mike Trout hit a homer and had 3 RBIs, Matt Thaiss had a homer and 2 RBIs. On the Royals side, Matt Duffy had 3 hits and an RBI, Hunter Dozier had 3 hits and 3 RBIs, and MJ Melendez drove in a pair and had a pair of knocks including a triple. Lots of offense in LA.

Royals POTG: Matt Duffy - 3/4, 3 R, RBI, 2 2B, BB

Angels POTG: Hunter Renfroe - 3/4, 3 R, 2 RBI, 2 HR (5,6), 2B

&amp;#x200B;

Cardinals (8-13) at Mariners (9-11)  Final: Mariners defeat Cardinals 5-4

Jarred Kelenic continues his breakout start to 2023 as he goes 2/4 with a long ball in the 2nd. Cardinal starter Mile Mikolas gave up 3 in 5.1 innings, surrendering a Teoscar Hernandez 2-run long ball in addition to Kelenics. Nolan Arenado, Wilson Contreras, and Nolan Gorman would all get RBIs and Tommy Edman homered in 9th to cut the lead to 1. Eugenio Suarez drove in 2 with a single in the 7th to make the difference. Matt Brash gets the win and Paul Sewald grabs save 6.

Mariners POTG: Jarred Kelenic - 2/4, R, RBI, HR (5) 

Cardinals POTG: Tommy Edman - 2/4, R, RBI, HR (3) 

&amp;#x200B;

Game to watch  Astros at Braves:

The Astros take the 2nd game of the 3-game set to clinch the series win. Sean Murphy started the scoring with his 5th homer of the year in the 4th inning.

Ozzie Albies would put the Braves within 1 with another 2-run homer in the bottom of the 6th, but the Astros pulled away with RBI singles from Corey Julks and Jose Abreu in the 8th and 9th respectively.

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Another would-be dominant week for the Rays was spoiled because, as it turns out, polar bears are natural predators of our fine-flapped friends. Fortunately, the dirty water of the East River has been left behind for a return to the cerulean gulf seas to face more darker blues. The bullpen is peak MacGyver right now, with Kevin Cash desparately trying to patch innings together with waivers, cash trades, and a very unstable stable. Luckily Glasnow has looked good in his rehab starts, he can't arrive soon enough. |**34-14**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**+1**| 4-2 on the week with two series wins including one against the Rangers who I have at 4th this week. If Shuster can provide a much needed stop gap in our injury depleted rotation, we can hopefully keep on winning until we can upgrade. Marcel Ozuna is a player of the month candiate and Acuna is the current unanimous MVP of the NL (and quite possibly the entire MLB). We are deep and we are good. Just keep doing your jobs. |**29-17**
**3**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| Interesting week for the Ranges, losing a very winnable series agains the Braves then sweeping the Rockies makes it a positive week. Bullpen is still scary. Go Stars. We're having fun. |**29-17**
**4**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+2**| I hesitated to put the Orioles at #1 this week, however I had to. They might be the best team in baseball right now. Of course, a bad week can change all that but for right now, they look great. Yes, Yennier Cano finally gave up a run, which ballooned his ERA to 0.38 and the offense hasn't clicked as much as the pitching, but they keep winning. They do keep mentioning the ""logjam"" of prospects in the infield though, which makes me really wonder who is/are the odd man/men out when the trading deadline approaches, and do they go for it all this year? Still a little ahead of schedule, would the fan base be irate if they did minor moves at the deadline and didn't get a #1/2 starter and a big bat? It is a problem I would love for the team to have come the end of July. |**31-16**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-3**|  |**29-19**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+3**| Altuve is back and the Framburglar is on the loose. Hide your kids, your wife, and your ballpark tour wristband. With so much uncertainty and inconsistency surrounding our pitching staff right now, it was great seeing a CGSO from Framber on Sunday. Short road trip this week, including a set against an old NL Central foe, which should get the team back to Houston in time to finally bury LMJ in the H - at least until the ASB.  |**27-19**
**7**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+3**| Judge is a machine, Rizzos raking, the Jays looked softer than their collective belt lines, Sevys back, Rortvedts real (and hes spectacular)... what more could you want out of a road trip?? Now its back to the Bronx with a full head of steam to take on the red hot Orioles. This is another big early series, and it should be a good one.  |**29-20**
**8**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**0**| West coast trips always seem to be trouble for us, and that trend continued with a 2-4 week in Los Angeles and what Arte Moreno thinks is Los Angeles. Our run differential for the trip was zero though, plus some bad umpiring (Minnesota has renewed its blood feud with Phil Cuzzi) and it feels like this trip could easily have swung the other way. Also, we beat Kershaw so that was nice. |**25-22**
**9**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+2**| The Diamondbacks had a good week, taking a series each from the A's and the Pirates. After a run of dominant outings, Zac Gallen got rocked in the first game in Pittsburgh, but the team rebounded to take the latter two games, including against Mitch Keller. Importantly, Corbin Carroll is stealing bases again after an injury scare a few weeks ago.  |**27-20**
**10**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-5**| Bad week. 1-6 vs the Yankees and Orioles. I could go on about the bad vibes, the offense disappearing, Manoah losing it, stupid nothing burger fake controversies like Judge's peeking, sticky stuff, etc. But instead, let me just say this: I just found out today that my younger cousin back in Ohio, whom I love, OD'ed at 34. I fucking hate drugs. Fentanyl and opiates have destroyed so much of the Rust Belt, and I'm honestly shocked when I find out people from back home are willing to still take the risk of buying a white powder. I now personally know 15 people who have died because of this shit, and I'm just over it. Hug your people. Ask about anyone you're worried about. Don't do the bad drugs.  |**25-22**
**11**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+1**| The Sox had a bounce-back week, taking 2 out of 3 against both Seattle and San Diego. Prior to the 2023 season, there were quite a few legitmate concerns about the Sox lineup and pitching staff that had most people (including myself) counting them out. While the pitching staff is still up in the air, the lineup has silenced all haters and/or fools who questioned them. Chaim has built serious depth, to the point where arguably the *worst* hitter in the lineup is our rookie 1B who has an .825 OPS in May and a 16.2 BB% for the season. The goal right now is to try and salvage some sort of rotation from our basket of should-just-be-multi-inning-reliever guys. Stay above .500 until Story returns from the IL, and go from there. |**26-21**
**12**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-5**| Going 5-5 for the week is okay, especially when you play the Rays at the Trop and hand them their 4th loss at home for the year.  Seriously, 21-4 at home Tampa Bay? What the hell?  Milwaukee is a pretty average team and has been weathering the decimation of the starting rotation fairly well, but I'm counting down the days until we can have the planned rotation back.  A slightly below average hitting team can't keep winning throwing out Joe Nobody to start. |**25-21**
**13**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+5**| The Mets are not good for my blood pressure, but they are good at baseball. They won 5 out of 6 this week (2 out of 3 from the Rays and a sweep of Cleveland) and seem to have staged 4 different dramatic comebacks in each of these games. Brett Baty's Statcast sliders are live and they're filthy. Alvarez and Vientos are hitting bombs of their own. Our retirement home of aces is finally working out. Pete Alonso has spent this week doing a lot of humping the air. Next up is 3 at Wrigley and 3 at Coors. |**25-23**
**14**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| Sunday was a welcomed return to form on the mound for Shohei Ohtani. Having split a four-game set to open the week in Baltimore, Shohei's solid six innings secured a series win against the Twins. A needed one at that. Of the eight home runs that Shohei has allowed, seven have come on pitches in the middle-to-lower-middle part of the plate. Around the sides and off the plate he has been largely unhittable.  |**25-23**
**15**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-2**| A tale of two series - blowouts for both teams in Boston, followed by three fairly close games in Atlanta. All in all, a 4-5 road trip. The pitching still generally looks great, but the offense... yeah. The season will be determined by whether the top-of-MLB pitching or the bottom-of-MLB hitting regresses to the mean first, and really, it could go either way at this point. Up next: 4 vs. Ramon Laureano plus 25 people I've never heard of, 3 vs. Pirates of the ~~Caribbean~~Allegheny |**22-24**
**16**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-1**| On Wednesday, the Pirates went up against Eduardo Rodriguez, who entered the game as one of the best pitchers in the American League this year. WHACK! The Bucs tagged him for 4 runs in 5 innings en route to an 8-0 victory. On Friday, the Pirates faced Zac Gallen, who has established himself as one of the best starters on the Senior Circuit. CRACK! POW! The Bucs dropped 8 runs on him and won 13-3. Also they lost every other game they played this week, |**24-22**
**17**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-1**| Immediately after I say that things are looking up for the Phillies, they lose 4 games to start the week against sub .500 teams. Then, they score more runs on Saturday than in their previous 5 games. Trea Turner continues to disappoint with an OPS 67 points lower than his previous career low while only stealing 5 bases. Kyle Schwarber has an appalling .174 batting average but apparently ripping dingers makes up for that and his terrible defense. Hopefully June Schwarber actually shows up this year. Aaron Nola is pitching deep into games again, going 7 innings in both outings this week including a 2 run, 10 strikeout performance on Sunday. In this wildly inconsistent season, I almost expect the Phillies to do well in 3 games against the Diamondbacks and 4 in Atlanta, but the Philly sports fan in me is expecting more disappointment. |**22-24**
**18**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+4**| 2-1 v MIL; 3-1 v LAD; the offense continues their tear with production from the entire lineup, Gorman most of all. Don't get distracted . . . |**21-27**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-2**| It's really hard to find anything positive to say about the club right now...so I won't! Instead let me pivot to something much more fun, Soccer! On Thursday, MLS announced its 30th club will be located in San Diego! The team will debut in 2025, so plenty of time for us to discuss the team colors, the name (not fcsdfcunitedclubsc please), and the branding, as well as learn about the league in general. I'm looking forwards to watching matches against Club Tijuana. What will those game's be called? Frontera fuego? Border Bonanza's?  |**21-26**
**20**|[](/SFG)|**Gigantes**|**+3**| Bad news first  Helliot Ramos will likely not impact the 2023 season with injuries and not goodness, Bart and Slater are out for another week, and Joc Pedersons love affair with the hospital continues. Anyway, the Giants had a extremely satisfying 5  1 week with the one loss being a 1  0 shutout, thus a 6  0 stretch was within reach. They swept the NL Champion Phillies and took 2 from the Marlins who are actually talented this year. Casey Schmitt continues to be the opposite of a mirage and now Bailey Patrick might be a thing and I will continue to reverse his name to remind me of Buster Posey. Here are the numbers, now correctly compared with last weak instead of guessing: 19th in MLB in Run Diff (+3 spots), 18th in RS / G (-2),  20th in RA / G (+4), 28th in Bullpen ERA (=). Playing good teams without a break continues  on the road @ the tough Twins who dominate a bad division and 4 @ Brewers. In case you were wondering, it's vs Pirates after that because apparently Manfred just wants us to play the Centrals. Unrelated, fuck John Fisher. |**22-24**
**21**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**0**| Well, after the second of appearance of [sweepy](https://i.redd.it/gl13n0e3bf791.jpg) against the Nats, we dropped a series in san fran to start off our west coast road trip. That being said, Soler is still mashing the hell out of the ball and Eury Perez is has now had two good outings to kick off his major league career. The offense has been scuffling somewhat now that jazz is out due to a foot injury but hopefully the marlins can get a series win in denver before we go off to anaheim to face off trout and shohei. oh yeah, heat and panthers in 5. |**24-23**
**22**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-3**| The Cubs continued their terrible recent play by going 1-5 this week. The starting pitching imploded, the bullpen continued to suck, and it seems like the offense's last hit with RISP was against the A's, who over the past 31 days are the only team worse than the Cubs. The good vibes of the first weeks of April is now a distant memory. Yet somehow, they are still only 5 games behind in the NL Central and 4 out of a Wild Card spot. A pivotal week looms, as the Cubs cannot afford to slip further if they wish to push for the playoffs. They host the Mets and Reds this week. |**20-26**
**23**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-3**| Do I really have to talk about the Guardians? I guess that's what I signed up to do. Another bad week of blowing leads. Whenever one thing seems to get better, another gets worse. |**20-26**
**24**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| Not too much of an eventful week. Miggy keeps getting his farewell gifts on the road (side note: do we really need to actually do these?), Javy Baez continues his resurgence, and we keep ticking down the minutes until the MLB Draft, where the boys will have their pick of anyone other than almost certainly Dylan Crews and Paul Skenes. This week: 3 at KCR, 4 vs. CWS. |**20-24**
**25**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Generally a 3-4 record in a week isn't anything to write home about, but for the 2023 Nationals that's a relatively cheerful feeling. After splitting a series with the Mets, the Nats got swept by the Marlins in 3 closely contested games (1 run, 1 run, 2 runs) and then took 2 of 3 from the Tigers. As of my ranking the Nationals at 27, anytime you take a series off a team above you, that's cause for cheering. |**20-27**
**26**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**-1**| The Reds are fine. Theyre just fine. What do you want me to say, theyre fine. Theyre okay, its just fine, everything is fine I dont know what you want from me everything is just fine. ITS OKAY. WERE FINE, I JUST WANT EVERYTHING TO BE FINE, ITS ALRIGHT TO FEEL SAD SOMETIMES. Thats what I've learned as of late. The Reds make me feel happy sometimes, but then they make me feel sad. Ive been feeling this for a while. Youve gotta find the positives sometimes. You know when youre sitting on the edge of a bed in a Motel 6 because your wife kicked you out after asking for a divorce, and its been 2 hours and you havent moved from the bed because youre staring at the carpet pattern on the floor. ITS A REALLY NICE PATTERN OKAY. I dont need to talk to anyone, Im just trying to figure things out, I still have to go and indulge in mediocrity at my shitty factory job tomorrow, Im just trying okay? Its a bad job, and Im pretty sure I've inhaled enough chemicals and dust to kill me by 60, Im not wanting to look on the sour side of things. Lets look at the positives, weeee baseball whoooo GO REDS YEAHHHHHHHHH. ARE WE FEELING HAPPY YET, COME ON SAY IT WITH ME, GO REDS, GO REDS, GO REDS. No? Not happy? Still thinking about your impending divorce from the woman you thought loved you? Still thinking about the custody of your only child? Still wondering how long you can live out of a Motel 6? This isnt even a nice motel, the breakfast isnt even that good, its just some stale muffins and discount off brand froot loops called Silly Circles or something and its just terrible, they have like 3 day old fruit that are well over ripe and their scrambled eggs are like out of a carton and they taste like foam. Oh maybe just make a waffle, they got that premade batter station, but oh its empty, IM STUCK EATING THE GODDAMN SILLY CIRCLES AGAIN, GODDAMMIT I HATE YOU SILLY CIRCLES. You know what, you know what Im gonna do, Im gonna find out who made these Silly Circles, I am going to find them and send them a box of Froot Loops, because they clearly dont know what Froot Loops are supposed to taste like. WHATS EVEN SILLY ABOUT IT, THEYRE JUST CIRCLES, THERE IS NOTHING SILLY ABOUT THEM I JUST WANT TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH MY DIVORCE AND THIS GODDAMN CEREAL IS RUINING MY DAY. Anyway the Reds lost like 5 million games this week, fuck me. |**19-27**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**+1**| It took until May 21st, but the White Sox have their first sweep of the season. All it took was the entire pitching staff show up. And, really, it's about time. White Sox pitching has been atrocious this year but has finally come along, posting a league-best 2.11 ERA over the last 10 days. Don't look now but after winning 4 of the last 6 series, the White Sox are *checks notes* only 10 games under 500. (And yet still only 9 games back in the division) |**19-29**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-1**| On the position player side, the Rockies are looking good for the future with Ezequiel Tovar, Brenton Doyle and Michael Toglia all getting regular playing time, with Doyle particularly standing out.  Now if they could call up Nolan Jones and maybe even Drew Romo, that'd be great.  The pitching side on the other hand, they called up two rookies with ERAs over 7 in AAA because they're pretty desperate for any arms that can throw major league innings.  |**19-28**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Vinnie Pasquantino wants to stay with the Royals for the rest of his career. The Royals need to make this happen. Only three players have guaranteed money for 2024, and two of those are Hunter Dozier and Jordan Lyles. That's not how one builds a winning team. Lock Pasquantino up, then sign some of the young core. Otherwise, it really might be 2045 until they win again. |**14-34**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| Yeah this sucks. the a's have 30 more L's than they do wins and its not even memorial day. They have 8 pitchers on the IL- most of them were supposed to be high leverage relievers or coliseum merchant starters. its either darkest just before the dawn (a new stadium in oakland and a winning team) or darkest just before it goes black (vegas) |**10-38**","baseball",91,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13p3dzk/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_weel_8_top_10_in/"

**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Everyone's favorite [myliobatiformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myliobatiformes) played another good week of baseball with the return of Tyler Glasnow. The Rays took an exciting series against the Dodgers after recharging during a weird mid-series rest day against the Blue Jays. Wander Franco is making his case to be starting SS in the All-Star Game, just make sure you don't accidentally vote for one of his brothers. It's still super weird to watch the offense carry while the bullpen struggles, but with guys coming back it should be f--, wait, Fairbanks is hurt again. |**39-17**
**2**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| Series wins against both the Pirates and Orioles the last week has the club holding the 3rd best overall record in the majors. Go Stars. We're still having fun. |**34-19**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-1**| 3-4 last week and we started this week off with a loss against the Oakland ""Triple A's"" which is not good Bob. On the VERY brightside, we saw Soroka pitch from an MLB mound for the first time in almost 3 years. He pitched well and we need him to perform as we are absolutely depleted by injuries. Riley is starting to come to life. We hold a 4 game lead on the scond place MARLINS. Our division doesn't want to take advantage of our recent struggles, that's fine by me. |**32-22**
**4**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**|  |**33-22**
**5**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| A few weeks ago, I said if the Orioles can go at least .500 in May then they are for real. They wrapped up a winning month yesterday and have three games to go. They continue to play well, even though they lost the series against the Rangers, and seem to play better away from Camden Yards. They did, however, send Grayson Rodriguez down this week to AAA. He just has some stuff to figure out. He was getting crushed in his past few starts, and it was the right move to make. This solidifies the fact they need a frontline starter if they are going to make a serious push to get to and make noise in the post-season. |**34-20**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| Jose Abreu finally hit a home run. All is right with the world. Unless the world's name is Lance McCullers Jr., who had another discomforting setback and we have no idea when we will see him this year. I still blame his hair. Anyway, our other Jose hit a grand slam at MMP this weekend. Where have we heard that before? |**31-22**
**7**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**0**| It certainly wouldve been nice to take 2/3 from Baltimore, but its very hard to be mad at the Yankees month of May. Since May 1, the Yankees are 18-9, a huge turnaround from a .500 April. As we enter the dog days of summer, the top of the AL East is tightening up, but the Yankees dont face either of the teams ahead of them again until July. The Yankees have to keep playing at this pace, and a Stanton (and maybe Rodon??) return could seriously help that.  |**33-23**
**8**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had a decent week, barely missing out on a sweep of the Phillies before dropping a series to the Red Sox. The offense gets on base but has been allergic to driving in RISP, and the starting rotation continues to be a merry-go-round, as none of the rookie pitchers on the team seem to be able to string together several good starts in a row without getting blown up once or twice.  |**31-23**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+1**| The Jays' first series win since May 14th pulled us out of a bad-vibes tailspin the likes of which this fanbase hasn't seen since, well, the last time everybody freaked out over a losing streak. The usual suspects' continued confounding slow starts (Manoah, Kirk, Varsho, etc) have dropped us 10 games back from TB, last place in the best division in baseball. And YET, hope springs. Berrios (3 or fewer ER in 8 of his last 9 starts) finally appears to be pitching to the level expected of him when he was signed, and is pumping out quality starts along with Gausman and Bassitt. Kikuchi has slipped as Kikuchi does but has been very solid for a #5. We don't have the depth to send Manoah down for some needed alone time, but he's pushing it. Vladdy has been scuffling, Springer is heating up, and Bichette is an MVP candidate. With a little bit of lucky regression to the mean with abysmal RISP numbers, this team is just a few turns away from being very good. As long as we don't have to play too many games vs AL East teams. That should be fine.  |**28-26**
**10**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-2**|  |**28-26**
**11**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+4**| Just what the doctor ordered - 6-1 in the homestand so far. Some momentum is just what this team needs before two big series with teams they're chasing for playoff spots. If the M's can handle business over the next week, they'll be right back in the thick of it. Bryce Miller, do your thing. Up next: 3 vs. Damn Yankees, 3 @ Globe Life ~~Park~~~~Field~~~~Stadium~~~~Gardens~~~~Arena~~~~Dome~~whatever they're calling it these days |**28-26**
**12**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-1**| Scoring four runs total while getting swept by the Angels isn't a great look. This team is in many ways aggresively mediocre, always making sure that every win streak is followed up by an equally painful gut-punch. This is mainly due to the reliance on the offense to carry us to victory (2-17 when scoring &lt;=3 runs), when the bats get cold, you're safe to turn off the game. Whitlock returning from injury and Bello/Sale both stepping up their game in May (2.74/2.42 ERA respectively) are good steps towards this team becoming Actually Good"" though. We'll see what June brings us...  |**28-25**
**13**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| Taking two of three from the Astros was nice.  Barely avoiding a sweep from the Giants was not so sweet.  Milwaukee has some issues with hitting in ""close"" situations.  The Brewers either lose after having multiple opportunities to tie it up, or get absolutely blown out.  |**28-25**
**14**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| Did I travel out of state and all the way to Anaheim just to watch the team get swept by the Marlins? Perhaps. Was that objectively worse than what the Reds voter is going through? It's impossible to say.  |**29-26**
**15**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-2**| The Mets, who I proclaimed to be ""good at baseball"" last week, ended up dropping 2 of 3 against the Cubs and doing the same against the Rockies. I just don't know what to believe anymore. The only thing I know for sure is that Francisco Alvarez has got that fucking dawg in him, he's GOATed, he's him, he's on fleek, he's poggers, he's a proper legend, he's got an .885 OPS, he's a top bloke, he's got swag, he's fresh, he's Gen Z Mike Piazza, he's lit, he's making me feel old because he was born after 9/11, he's Francisco Alvarez. |**27-27**
**16**|[](/SFG)|**Gigantes**|**+4**| The Giants won yesterday, but strictly talking about last week, they went 5- 2 on an extremely acceptable road trip without any off days. Defeating two competent teams like the Twins and Brewers should feel good. On both losses, they gave up 7 runs, on every win they gave up 3, 1, or 0 runs. So, they threw two games out of 7  thats allowed. In the bad news department, Joc, Joey, and Thairo all not expected back until June 6th. I think were okay with more Bailey Patrick and this also means another look at unpredictable slugger David Villar. Slater continues covering for Joc. Lets look a the numbers: 13th in MLB in Run Diff (+6 spots), 12th in RS / G (+6), 15th in RA / G (+2), 23rd in Bullpen ERA (+5). All of that is good and especially the bullpen is promising recently. The Giants continue at home vs the Pirates  and wrap the homestand with 3 against our orange and black brothers in Baltimore. |**28-26**
**17**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-1**| Would I have been happy to learn on Opening Day that the Pirates would be around .500 at the end of May? Yes. But if you told me they got there after starting 20-8 I would be pretty disappointed. Here's hoping the pendulum swings the other way in June. |**26-27**
**18**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+3**|Yet another appearance of sweepy, the meme that was promised. After a rough series against the rox, we sweep the angels to settle into the third NL wild card spot. Our starting pitching is coming along after a bumpy start to several of our starters. Eury perez is gonna be a stud, just wanna remind yall. Also, shout out to Jorge Soler, who has been crushing baseballs the last week and change. In other miami sports related news, boston is the first city ever to lose two game 7s at home in both the NHL and NBA playoffs in the same year. Go Heat and go Panthers!|**28-26**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| After losing 2 to the Diamondbacks and going down 5-0 in the 3rd game, the Phillies season looked as bleak as it could in late May while only being 4 games under .500. However, the team rallied and Trea Turner tied it in the 9th before going onto win it in 10. Then, they went down to Atlanta and split a 4 game series. It could've gone far worse. The Phillies most pressing need is now seemingly a 5th starter who isn't a guaranteed loss, as this week they trotted out Dylan Covey, who hadn't started a game since 2019. He got 2 outs and gave up 7 runs. He took the spot of Bailey Falter who, after a surprisingly productive 2022, started the season 0-7. Falter is the far better option, but Dave Dombrowski will likely be looking to upgrade until Andrew Painter can finally return. This week, the NL East road trip continues with their first 3 games against the Mets and 3 in Washington. Here's hoping June Schwarber shows up again this year. |**25-28**
**20**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| My Dad tells me its ok that the Dads lost 2 / 3 to NY; the Dodgers lost 2 / 3 to the Rays! The Pads arent in the same stratosphere as the Dodgers right now, though. 5 games under .500, 10th in the NL standings, 3 games out of the last wildcard slot. Of course theres quite a bit of time to change it, theres plenty of time to go on a run, or a slow and steady good month to gain ground. With every day that passes however, that goal becomes a bit harder to reach; I dont think Pads fans were hoping for a wildcard spot by the end of this season, but thats the position the team has to get to before even thinking of catching LA. The Padres are 4th in the NL West, and only a half game out of last. |**24-29**
**21**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-3**| 2-2 @ CIN; 1-2 @ CLE; 0-1 v KCR; another struggle week for the Cards. The fandom's been a bit kneejerk because of two good weeks before this. Their mistake. I'll say it a third time, the Cards playing at or beyond their expected level doesn't change the rotten FO. Yeah Marmol's pretty close to being fired, that's not a fix when the problem is John Mozeliak. |**24-32**
**22**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+2**| The most fun part of this past week has been watching the resurgence of Akil Baddoo. His energy is infectious and adds an exciting dimension to the lineup. As we head into the last few days of May, Baddoo has sported a .302/.405/.508 slash and a 155 wRC+ this month. Although he's still been hitting mostly in the 6 hole, if this keeps up he might find himself much higher in the order real soon. This week: 2 more vs. TEX and 3 at CWS. |**25-27**
**23**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians won a series this week. I would like to see them win some games by more than one run, but it's clear this season, we have to take what we get. |**24-29**
**24**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**| Another terrible week for the Cubs, as a promising series win against the Mets was followed up by an embarrassing sweep against the Reds. The starting rotation was terrible, and the bullpen was somehow worse. Fans have had enough of David Ross, and Jed Hoyer is starting to come under pressure. Barring a dramatic turnaround, the Cubs will be sellers for the 3rd trade deadline in a row |**23-30**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+1**| Okay guys, Im here to be calm this week. I have been told by my wifes attorney, Tom, that they are aware of my online activity regarding our impending divorce, so today lets have a nice, calm, relaxing, perfectly fine, good old fashioned talk about Reds baseball. The Reds are just sorta middling. Theyre not great but theyre not horrible. Unlike my marriage. Our starting pitching has resgressed, just like my marriage, and its very unfortunate to see, because our bullpen has been quite reliable unlike my wife. We still cant hit home runs for some reason, but overall unlike my marriage the Reds on the upturn. There, are you happy Tom? I didnt mention all the crap thats been going on lately. I didnt mention how I had to leave the Motel 6 I was at because I found a used needle in the bathroom, and by the way Tom, I know that youre trying to use that as evidence that I cant take care of my kids. I dont even know whos needle it was, it was like wedged behind the toilet. Believe me, I only found it because I dropped my phone while using the toilet. It wasnt even visible, I had to like get on my hands and knees and crawl behind the toilet to grab my phone. So it puts the image in my head of some heroin addict or whatever sitting behind a toilet at a Motel 6 trying to get high, which honestly that just seems like an even worse situation than the one im in. Do I think its a coincidence that the day after I left the Motel 6 because of this, youre requesting a drug test from me before I can see my kids? Huh Tom? How did you know about this incident Tom? The only people that know are the Motel 6 staff I notified, I dont think any police showed up, so either you questioned them like im some criminal, or youre following me. I know youre reading this Tom, youve made several references to my posts on the baseball power rankings insinuating its me writing them, and yeah Tom youre right it is me, can everybody in the comments give praise to Tom for being a regular Sherlock Holmes? Yeah everybody come on, Congratulations Tom! Youre the man! Im gonna let you go home and fuck my sister, oh wait Tom I forgot, YOU ALREADY ARE. When you get home tonight tell Caitlin her brother says hi. Alright, I think I got that out of my system. Anyway, I think once more of our prospects are called up, probably around June or July, we may get hot and finish more closely to .500 than initially thought, and if this division stays like it is, and those prospects can deliver on their promise, it's entirely possible we could be in contention for the division. But a lot of this is gonna depend on if our Starting Rotation can get things back under control. Also we swept the Cubs so lol. |**24-29**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Week after week, I expect this Nats team to take a nose dive. I expect them to crumble and slip into a double-digit losing streak but it just isn't happening. They lead the NL in batting average (.267), are third in OBP (.330) and have the lowest strikeout rate in MLB. They still have their own troubles, but this team is alive (4 games out of a WC spot) |**23-31**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**+1**| I don't have time to write a real blurb this week so you don't have to print this.  Actually, you probably don't read these, I'm not sure anyone really reads them anyways besides the Reds guy's life breaking down, and this will probably get printed regardless. |**24-31**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-1**| Liam is back. I can't overstate how great that is to hear. He is one of the best people in the game and it's nothing short of amazing for him to be pitching in May. If you missed it, it was recently revealed that he had stage 4 lymphoma, not an early stage. He started treatment just over 3 months ago! Nothing on the field matters for this team, but at least there's that silver lining. |**22-34**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| As of the time that this blurb is being written (Monday at 11:39 AM), only two teams in the majors have a record below .400. Yup, the Royals are there with the A's. I suppose the positive is that the team figured out that they can get rid of useless players in Hunter Dozier, but they still have a lot more work to do. |**17-38**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Atléticos**|**0**| The A's have given up 10+ runs in a game 7 more times than they've won. It's a mix of bad roster building (the bullpen), under-preforming vets (Ramon Laureano 74 wRC+, Tony Kemp 38 wRC+), injuries (Seth Brown and Paul Blackburn are just now returning), and no fans in the stands since 2019. It's soul crushing to watch and the national media's constant condecention toward this particular poor team and it is even more annoying this year. |**11-45**","baseball",60,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13w2ovi/2023_rbasbeall_power_rankings_week_9_tuesday/"

**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| This was easily the worst week of the season for the Rays. Even though you'd be generally happy to split a series away at The Porcho Grounds, it felt like a loss. Doubly so because Drew Rasmussen hit the 60-Day IL, becoming the second Rays SP to possibly be done after an amazing start. The bullpen is becoming more of a concern, as several previously-solid guys are starting to leak runs at a concerning rate, and has [fans looking like, well](https://i.redd.it/an7phu6zoxza1.jpg). The offense is scoring runs though and as long as Wander and Yandy don't succumb to their knocks it should continue. Some metro east commentators have even suggested foul play for the Rays results, and Taylor Walls suddenly being able to hit isn't helping those accusations.  |**31-11**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**| And just like that, the Dodgers have returned to their familiar spot at the top of the NL standings, riding a stretch where they have won 13 of their last 15. While Muncy and Outman carried the Dodgers through April, Mookie Betts and Will Smith have taken the reigns for the month of May, with Mookie hitting multiple game-changing, late-inning homers and Will Smith posting a 198 wRC+ over the last two weeks. The key bounceback has been the bullpen. which just a few weeks ago was bottom five but have posted a 2.55 ERA this month. |**26-15**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-1**| Oof. 1-4 on the week and the injuries keep coming. We need to figure out our starting pitching. With Fried and Wright now on the IL for substantial time, we have a glaring hole in our rotation. Soroka isn't ready, so we will be leaning on young arms to fill that gap. Toronto is the real deal, but we had opportunities to win that series. Not scoring with RISP and less than 2 outs way too many times. It doesn't get any easier from here with the surprising Rangers up next. |**25-15**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| 10 games over .500, went 7-3 during a 10 games divisional road trip. 4 games up on the division. Corey Seager is on the way back so this offense can get even better. We're having fun. |**25-15**
**5**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| Short but impactful week where we dropped two to Philly and swept the Braves in an amazingly bonkers series that would be a fantastic World Series matchup. Chris Bassitt was the big standout, throwing up a 2H, 8K, 2BB CGSO and outdueing Spencer fucking Strider and his Miraculous Mustache. He threw 6 different pitches at least 7 times in the game. It was the first CGSO we've had since Burly Buehrle in 2015, and our first 9-inning CG since Stroman in '17 (both MLB-record lengths). If you take out his very bad first start of the season (3.1 IP, 10 H, 9 R, 0 K), Bassitt has a 1.97 ERA while holding opposing batters to a .138 BA over his last 7 games. Considering how pedestrian Manoah has been so far, Bassitt, Kikuchi, and Berrios' performances have been a revelation. This team could be very good, especially if some other underperforming stars (Springer, Kirk, Varsho) heat up. Big week ahead, with daaaa Yankees in town for 4, followed by 3 vs those sneaky-hot Orioles. |**24-16**
**6**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| Another series win, I would like to say winning two out of three every series is boring, but it honestly isn't. The Orioles are playing close to .700 baseball and are having fun. Have you seen the new bird bath/splash zone? In my humble opinion they still need a hitter or two and definitely and number 1 rotation guy, but right now this team looks good and continues to battle every game. Big series starts today with the Angels, four games. 3 wins would be nice. |**26-14**
**7**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+1**| Two call outs this week. Own Miller slashing .400/.400/.800. The Mequon WI native has now reached base safely in 16 consecutive games.   Christian Yelich slashing .400/.478/.850 including 3 home runs and 3 stolen bases. The once MVP is back to just [murdering](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2023/2023-05/14/6299c1ae-38c6df4c-a6d9d3fa-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4) [balls](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2023/2023-05/13/e15d852a-eb8d7327-e1a8599e-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4)  |**23-17**
**8**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**| Alex Kiriloff is back and seems to have sparked the offense! After a slow start Correa is riding a 5 game extra base hit streak, Joey Gallo broke statcast with a monster home run, and the Twins now have a winning record against teams below .500 by virtue of keeping the Padres and Cubs below .500. |**23-18**
**9**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+1**| Overall an okay week. It really does seem like we can't count on any injured players to return when the organization says they will, with the exception of Altuve, who seems to be ahead of schedule in his rehab assignment. Michael Brantley might star in the next reboot of Old Yeller. Hoping we can turn things around a bit with a quick homestand. |**21-19**
**10**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+5**| Evidently the Yankees *can* score runs, and not just against the A's. This team took Tampa seriously, and while 3/4 would've been nice, I think Yankees fans should be happy (emphasis on ""should be"") with how the Bombers looked. These are an important four games against Toronto let's hope the bats keep rolling.  |**23-19**
**11**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+3**| The Diamondbacks had an okay week, losing two of three to the Marlins before taking three of four against the Giants. The pitching has mostly looked a bit better over the past week, and the offense is still mostly finding ways to score runs even with a slumping Corbin Carroll not contributing much toward the top of the lineup. Importantly, recently-called-up top prospect Brandon Pfaadt looked pretty good in his outing against the Giants.  |**23-18**
**12**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-5**| It turns out that this whole ""starting pitching"" thing is an issue we might have to address. Houck is incapable of pitching third time around the order, Kluber is cooked, and Pivetta is getting slammed to the tune of a 93.2 average exit velocity. The ""upside"" for this rotation are two 34 year olds who threw a *combined* 70.0 IP from 2020-2022. If the offense isn't hot, this team isn't doing much. Hey, at least we managed to finally DFA Brasier... |**22-19**
**13**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+5**|  |**20-20**
**14**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-1**| A 2-4 week with several games that could have gone either way, including yet another painful meltdown at the end of their game on Saturday, the Angels are still looking for answers with how to win close games. Mike Trout has really cooled off in recent weeks, having just two extra base hits in the month of May, and overall he has the lowest ISO of his career since his age 19 season where he played in only 40 games. The team is in an OK place as we hit the quarter-post of the season, but it feels like they have some better baseball in them that is waiting to fully click.  |**21-20**
**15**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-3**| The Pirates won two games in the last week, and both were started by Mitch Keller. It has been a long journey for the former top prospect. He gave up a grand slam in the first inning of his big-league debut, and then had one of the biggest ERA-FIP splits in history. He struggled in 2020 and 2021, and this time a year ago he was shaping up to be another Pirates pitching bust. But since adding some velocity, a sinker, and a sweeper, Keller has transformed himself into one of the best pitchers in the National League. The Pirates should do whatever they can to sign him long-term.  |**22-19**
**16**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+3**| The Phillies are back at .500 and shockingly only 5 back from the Braves. A division title still feels very unlikely, but it's a surprisingly good position all things considered. Bryce Harper is Bryce Harper, Nick Castellanos is pre-2022 Nick Castellanos, and Zack Wheeler had a vintage Zack Wheeler game. An injury to Jose Alvarado is concerning, especially considering how shaky Seranthony Dominguez has been, but Kimbrel and Gregory Soto are both looking to step up in his absence. It's starting to get concerning for Trea Turner, as his bat hasn't improved while making 2 errors on back to back days in Colorado. The season is young, however, and the team looks like it should be successful through the dog days of summer. This week: 3 games in San Francisco before heading back to Philly for 3 against the Cubbies.  |**20-20**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-6**| Ok. Press the button. If Bo Mel being thrown out of the game on Thursday, and losing 5 / 6 to the Dodgers on back to back weekend series's isn't something to pay attention to, I don't know what is. I doubt the Pads will end up with the worst Risp batting average since 1969 (not nice), but it's still worth looking into.  |**19-22**
**18**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| I don't think the Mets are trash by any measure, but they continued to not really do a lot to show that they're a serious contender. Since my last update, they dropped 2 out of 3 in Cincy and have taken 2 out of 3 in DC. I was at the game in DC on Sunday. I wanted to wear my Max jersey but it's like 3 sizes too big because it was the only size available at the store when he first signed with us. It looks like a baby wearing his dad's Mets jersey for a silly photo, it's really a bad look for an adult. Scherzer finally looked like himself again and Bill Nye the Science Guy was sitting like 5 feet away from me. I walked back to my apartment from Nats Park and some elderly jogger outside the Capitol asked me for the score of the game. It caused a bit of an existential crisis. I'm 28, and this guy was like 65 and looked way more physically fit than me. There were also a bunch of barricades outside the Capitol for some event and the rat-in-a-maze effect really added to the existential dread. I also really had to piss. Returning to the Mets, Tomas Nido's eyes are completely fucked. I'm not really equipped to explain what's going on, evidently they're too dry, but in a severe enough way that he needs some time to recuperate. |**20-21**
**19**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-3**| Another disappointing week for the Cubs, as they slumped to a 2-4 week against the Cardinals and Twins. Christopher Morel has been red hot since being called up, but he has not been enough to fix the Cubs' recent issues with RISP. Neither has the starting pitching hasn't been as dominant as earlier, with Marcus Stroman and Hayden Wesneski getting rocked vs the Twins. The Cubs will look to turn things around this week vs the Astros and Phillies |**19-21**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| This week, the Guardians went 3-3. An improvement over the last few weeks. They also won two of their last three series. So things might be getting better. At the same time, I fear too much damage has been done. Unrelated to the Guardians: I liked how the season started out with several teams who we didn't expect to do well were doing well, like the Pirates, Cubs, Diamondbacks, Rangers and Orioles. Most of those teams have started to crash and burn and now the usual suspects are back on top. |**19-21**
**21**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| The injuries have arrived to the offense with jazz and sanchez being out with leg injuries. nothing serious thankfully but damn this timing sucks. In other news, Eury Perez had a solid start in his debut, only 2 ER and 2 BB over 4.2 IP with 7 strikeouts. His fastball command was as advertised. we got the nats at home and we start off a west coast/denver road trip in san fran this week. |**20-21**
**22**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+2**| 2-1 @ CHC; 3-0 @ BOS; the Cards blowing past expectations to play way better than they should is quite the surprise. Don't get distracted, the FO's still gotta go.  |**16-25**
**23**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-2**| Hmmmm. Not great, Bob. The Giants dropped a series to the un-good Nationals and then got clapped by the solid-to-good DBacks. Casey Schmitt is apparently the future of the left side of the Giants infield though, so thats cool. Real talk: the Giants went 2-5 this week and it EASILY could have been a 4-3 stretch. Doesnt feel great, but it also doesnt feel like this team is actually bad. However, here are the numbers: 22nd in MLB in Run Diff (meh), 16th in RS/G (fine, sure), 24th in RA/G (somehow improved??), 28th in bullpen ERA (hahahahahah). Whats next? The NL East at home  Phillies then Marlins.  Both teams are in the neighborhood of the Giants and they should, theoretically, be able to have a good week. |**17-23**
**24**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-1**|  |**18-21**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| Unlike my marriage this was a great bounce back week for the Reds. Series victories over the Mets and Marlins with the Bullpen being pushed to the limit without breaking really emphasize the team's willingness to continue fighting to make things work, unlike my Wife. You know she won't even accept couples therapy? Like I found someone perfect to mediate things and she's just like ""This has been a long time coming I think we both know this, some therapist isn't going to help"", like how would you even know that if you won't try? Anyway, Jonathan India is playing like an All-Star and Jake Fraley is a clutch king. But then she tells me she would rather our son stay with her instead of me because ""My parents live closer to the school"", like we arguably live the same distance to the school I know that's not the issue. She thinks our son living with his mother is more important than their father, like come on he's 10 not 3. Then she tells me I need to stop calling her because she needs her space to ""work it out"", like it seems to me that you've already got it well situated and your mind is made up that you're not even gonna TRY and get this marriage back on track. Like I know we have our issues, we married way too young and had a kid too soon, I get it, but I don't want to just have things end so quick you know? Anyway our bullpen has been extremely good as of late, winning 2 bullpen games in under a week, some great performances all around. You know I took a shit factory job I didn't want because I believed this family was more important than my dreams, so I didn't go to college, I didn't experience life after high school, I didn't make friends, I barely see my son, I feel like a stranger to him, this is just how life works sometimes and it sucks. It's the feeling that hits you when you're standing at a public urinal crying because you don't want to deal with it, something I've been doing a lot lately. But I'm not giving up. Very much like the Reds, and unlike my wife, I'm not a quitter. |**18-22**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Despite the Nationals clearly not intending to compete, they are finding some really stunning ways to be competitive. Of the 23 losses this season, 12 have been less than 2 runs and 8 were 1-run games. Also as a sidebar: the 2023 New York Metropolitan Billionaires are in town this weekend and play today for the 7th game in the season; the H2H record sits at 3-3. |**17-23**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| I guess we're ""loser fucking organization"" Every single one of us. |**17-24**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| The White Sox came into the week with just a tiny bit of momentum after edging out two series wins. They were about to play one of the few teams in the league they could argue is worse than them. Kansas City took that personally and embarrassed the Sox twice while winning 3 of 4. The lone bright spot now is Luis Robert Jr., who is on fire and leading the AL in most offensive categories in the first half of May. The White Sox are a flat out embarrassing team on the field right now. To think that they are this bad in the middle of what was supposed to be their contention window is truly an indictment on the organization from top to bottom. [Insert Berto from the West Side.](https://www.reddit.com/r/whitesox/comments/13047jn/heres_an_alltime_espn_1000_call_about_the_2023/) |**14-28**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Well, Zack Greinke continues to be one of the greatest things going in baseball and Freddy Fermin pulled off a walk-off safety squeeze. At least there is some entertainment with the Royals. It is one thing to be bad but being boring would make it even worse. |**12-30**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| There's been 40 games so far in this season and the A's do not yet have 10 wins. The offense is palatable- with Brent Rooker posting a breakout season and young stars Esteury Ruiz and Jordan Diaz becoming regulars. Just last week, Diaz hit three HR's in New York (in a loss). If you're trying to think of the worst pitchers in baseball, many of them are Athletics. The bullpen has turned over entirely since opening day, except for Zach Jackson and Sam Moll. Usually the A's front office doesn't whiff that poorly on a bullpen, but it's part of the reason why the a's are ""historically bad"" and not just ""regular bad"". Oh, and the 4th toughest SoS isn't helping. |**9-33**","baseball",46,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13ikmev/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_7_dodgers_aim/"

#**#10 - Juan Soto - San Diego Padres [](/SD) - Right Fielder**

**Written by:** u/notfelixhernandez

Over the last couple of years, there has been unending chatter about Juan Soto. His obvious slumps, his possible contract, his eventual trade. It all made for great headlines yet the snuck premise in all of these topics -- the absurdity of his talent -- wasn't given the attention it deserved.

Since he debuted at 19 years old, Soto has not posted an OBP under .400 in any year. We're talking about numbers that sneak into prime Joey Votto territory from basically a kid. Votto himself didn't even play a full season until he was 24; meanwhile, a 23 year old Juan Soto ""slogged"" through a down year that saw him lead the league in BB% by far and post a 145 wRC+ -- good for 10th among all qualified batters.

Surely there is some fatigue in waiting for Soto to fully unleash his talent over a full season, but it's not a stretch to think the best is yet to come. In fact, it's purely projection. There's no talk of his physical peak yet. There's no ""man strength"" yet. There is just the consistent in-game demonstration of an otherworldly talent at an age where many people are still freshly out of college and/or beginning their careers. Now that he is firmly planted in San Diego, it is time for the narrative to shift back onto the sheer talent of Juan Soto...at least until he nears free agency.

#**#9 - Nolan Arenado - St. Louis Cardinals [](/STL) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** /u/0000zero00000 

Two years after a brutal pandemic season and an acrimonious extraction from Denver, the former Rockies cornerstone re-established himself as one of the games premier two-way players in St. Louis with an improved 2021 and a roaring 2022 that represented either his best or sixth-best season offensive season (ranked by park-adjusted OPS+ or raw OPS, respectively) and quieted any doubts about his performance outside of Coors Field. Arenados just-right resurgence wasnt quite enough to entice him to exercise his opt-out this offseason, but was more than enough to thrill the extremely short-suffering Cardinals fandom and ignite discussions about whose cap he might wear into the Hall of Fame.



_____________

#**#8 - Jose Ramirez - Cleveland Guardians [](/CLE) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** u/e_schlanzz

After a tumultuous offseason of uncertainty as to which uniform Jose Ramirez would don for the 2022 season, he signed an extension to remain in Cleveland for the foreseeable future. He then proceeded to reward the organization and their fans with his sixth season in seven finishing in the top 6 of MVP voting. His 148 OPS+ delivered 29 HRs, a league-leading 44 doubles, and a career high 126 RBI, all on a nagging thumb injury

Ramirez is one of MLBs unique and underappreciated superstars, with a personality as loud as his demeanor is quiet. He is a leader, showman, and elite athlete. Tune in to a Guardians game and youre just as likely to see him messing with the dugout reporter, pulling at a teammates ear, or chirping someone on the field as you are to see an incredulous stop at 3rd, a dazzling baserunning display, or a clutch hit in a crucial spot. He truly is the gift that keeps on giving.

Clevelanders regularly grow frustrated that he, like many others to play in this town, dont get the recognition they feel he deserves nationally. But Ramirez seems content staying out of the limelight. Just as in his plate approach, he stays quiet, patiently waiting for the right opportunity to let his true talent and personality shine.

#**#7 - Manny Machado - San Diego Padres [](/SD) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** u/notfelixhernandez

The continued excellence of Manny Machado should not be understated, and with an impending opt-out available following the 2023 season, nor should it be taken for granted. Once mired in controversy stemming from immature play, Machado hasn't fully shaken his reputation for asshattery, but he has rightfully become beloved in San Diego for his on-field performance as well as his work in the community. 

Amidst a career year that saw him hit .298/.366/.531 for a personal best 152 wRC+, Machado began a new initiative -- [Manny's Hot Corner](https://twitter.com/annieheilbrunn/status/1529242224759689216?s=20&amp;t=jEjpI9FUVbsyk5pF-fmV2A) -- to bring hundreds of kids from underserved areas of SD/Tijuana to Petco Park to meet him and watch the game with free food, drinks, and more! He was the harbinger of a new era in San Diego when he signed, and now four years later, he has meant so much more to the team and the city beyond delivering on that promise. 

Coming off a 7.4 fWAR/6.8 rWAR/4.5 WARP season, Machado has firmly established himself as the face of the franchise, and the certainty of his production (even if some metrics aren't as crazy about his defense) makes him well-deserving of his spot among baseball's absolute best players.

#**#6 - Trea Turner - Philadelphia Phillies [](/PHI) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/Pjd7510

Following their incredible run to the World Series, the reigning NL Champion Philadelphia Phillies decided to treat themselves by bringing in Trea Turner as their new shortstop on an 11 year $310 Million dollar deal. In 2022 Trea Turner continued to solidify himself as the top shortstop in baseball finishing with a 20/20 season while also earning his second career All Star Selection and first career Silver Slugger Award. With the new pick off rules and larger bases coming in 2023, one of the best base stealers in baseball should only get better while hitting atop the Phillies deep line up.

#**#5 - Yordan Alvarez - Houston Astros [](/HOU) - Designated Hitter**

**Written by:** u/FederalLeagueMVP

At the 2015 Trade Deadline, the Dodgers made arguably the worst trade in baseball history, swapping a teenager from Cuba in their system for Josh Fields. Yordan was a dynamic force through the minors and for his rookie campaign in 2019, slashing .313/.412/.655. Arthroscopic surgery on both knees troubled many and shut down his '20 season. The clamoring doubters from the peanut gallery stepped up their logical criticisms. Affectionately called ""the big boy in the middle"", Yordan always had defensive question marks and knee surgery always makes people weary.

In 2021, he slashed .277/.346/.531 which wasn't as great as that red hot rookie start, even though he once again appearance on the national stage in the World Series. In 2022, his age-25 season, he kicked his career into high gear. At this point he is a solid if unspectacular left fielder, navigating the Crawford Boxes well at home. But at the plate... he seems omnipotent. Sure, he fails 70% of the time or whatever, but you wouldn't think that watching him play. He flicks baseball with terrifying ev's like it's a regular occurrence, and it is! His percentile card on baseball savant includes eight bright red circles.

Seriously he put up a .672 xSLG, 6+ WAR and 185 wRC+ at age-25! Up until a hand injury slowed him down after the all star break he was on track to put up a 200+ wRC+ season, which means he would have been twice as good as the league average hitter. He quickly reached the territory of ""walk him to avoid the heartache"" awesome, but still had time to hit two of the most clutch, titanic home runs in modern postseason history. I don't even have to go into the details- you know what I mean.

This exercise has been a wonderful insight to the inner thoughts of others and a lesson in tolerance of opinions about the world's best sport. There's nothing at all forgettable or boring about Yordan Alvarez, yet some of my fellow jokers didn't put him in the top 5 where he belongs? I somehow got more flack for putting Yordan # 1 on my first draft than some did for putting him outside the top 15! Both of those takes are crazy but the latter sounds more delusional! Please feel free to try and critique this argument in the comments but Yordan is the closest thing we have to Barry Bonds- and he's just getting started!

#**#4 - Mike Trout - Los Angeles Angels [](/LAA) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** u/Pjd7510

The Millville Meteor kept on slugging in 2022, blasting 40 home runs and posting a .630 Slugging Percentage, the second highest of his Hall Of Fame Career. Once again injury was the biggest enemy for Trout as he was limited to 119 games after only playing in 36 the year before. Trout earned his 10th All Star Selection and 9th Silver Slugger and will look to combat the injury bug n 2023 and try and help carry the Angels to a postseason appearance.

_____________

#**#3 - Mookie Betts - Los Angeles Dodgers [](/LAD) - Right Fielder**

**Written by:** u/thefuckinwolves

Mookie Betts is who you think he is. He is one of the 10 best hitters in baseball and likely one of the 10 best fielders and baserunners in baseball. He put up yet another season evidencing these claims in 2022, as he hit .269/.340/.533 in another humdrum six win season. Oh, he also has one of the best arms in the game and can play an outstanding second base (Why don't we talk about this more? That's sick?) in a pinch. I genuinely am at a loss of what to say about him. He's just a clear and consistent, yet somehow quiet, top five player in the game.

#**#2 - Aaron Judge - New York Yankees [](/NYY) - Right Fielder**

**Written by:** u/Pjd7510

Prior to the 2022 season the Yankees offered Aaron Judge a 7 year, $213.5 Million Dollar Contract extension, rather than accept it Judge decided to bet on himself. That bet proved to be the right decision as Judge would go on to become the new American League Single Season Home Run King with a 62 home run season and American League MVP Award. In the offseason Judge signed a 9 year, $360 Million Dollar deal to stay in New York where he will look to try and power the team to their first World Series appearance since 2009.

#**#1 - Shohei Ohtani - Los Angeles Angels [](/LAA) - Designated Hitter/Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/wharblegarblemuricah

What can be said about Shohei that hasnt already been said? He came over from Japan to the Angels for the 2018 season and immediately impressed, winning the Rookie of the Year award on the back of a .285/.361/.564 slash line& [oh and I guess he could pitch a bit too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2I1-2pAncg)

Following his Tommy John that year and coming back in 2019 with a mostly similar offensive season (.286/.343/.505, 120 wRC+), many were expecting 2020 to be the year he finally explodes into a superstar and shows everyone why so many teams coveted him when he made the jump from Japan. 

Yeah& about 2020.

With the spread of COVID-19 shutting down, well, everything, the baseball season was put on hold for a while (and lets not forget the union and the league getting into it about how long the season should be and how much money and the whole thing being the precursor to the lockout) before we got our 60 game season. And as expected, Shohei Ohtani&. was bad? Very, very bad.

In his first start on the mound after coming back from Tommy John [he didnt record a single out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzE0qbAmL8A) while walking 3, giving up 3 hits, and being hit with 5 ER. In his second start, he struggled through 1.2 innings, not allowing a hit and striking out 2 but walking 5 batters and being shut down shortly thereafter. Shohei the Hitter wasnt much better, hitting .190/.291/.366 and never being able to get into a rhythm. We began to see questions as to whether or not the two-way player experiment was going to work for him& and then 2021 came along. 

[The man literally gave us a warning shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDHihWAKicI) 46 HR, 151 wRC+, 130 IP, 156 K, a 3.18 ERA, AL MVP. He finally arrived and gave us one of the greatest performances in the history of the game. And then in 2022, with no restrictions, he followed it up with 166 IP, 219 K, a 2.33 ERA and another 34 HR and a 142 wRC+! _He found a way to get better._

Argue all you want about whether or not he was the MVP again in 2022, there has never been a player in the entire history of the sport we love that can pitch the way he pitches while hitting the way he hits. Babe, Ted, Lou, and Barry never threw 101. Pedro, Sandy, Nolan, and Randy never hit 40 HR. Shohei Ohtani is truly doing things none of us have ever seen and is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best player in the game of baseball.","baseball",51,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10m57zl/rbaseball_top_100_players_for_the_2023_season_101/"

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**|  |**70-39**
**2**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+1**| When I sat down with Mike Elias this weekend, he mentioned to me that he saw my post the day of the trade deadline. He then asked how I knew which teams the Orioles were targeting to make a trade with. I told him sometimes you just know. The addition of Jack Flaherty should help the rotation down the stretch. Again, we have to keep this in perspective as they are ahead of schedule. Jackson Holliday is hitting right around .400 in AA, hot take for next year, he will make the opening day roster. |**70-42**
**3**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| The Rangers took this week to sweep the White Sox and Marlins to grab some momentum after the Trade Deadline. Unfortunatley, injuries continue to pile up as now Josh Jung is out with a broken thumb, which potentially ends his Rookie of the Year campaign unfortunately. Seager did return but Heim and Eovaldi are still out for a few more weeks. Hopefully the team can continue their momentum from the homestand to the bay this week as they have series agains the A's and Giants. |**66-46**
**4**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-2**| The deadline has passed, and despite the need for Mead, the Rays kept it mostly Civale. Comedy night aside, the Rays need someone to pitch quality innings with injuries to the rotation, a more down-to-earth offense, and an unusually unreliable bullpen. The return of Rasmo to supplement Civale will go a long way ot support this goal. Curtis Mead is the hottest bat prospect the Rays have, and while he's no longer batting 1.000, he'll add some excitement back to the lineup. The Rays have won their last few series, and will need to keep it up to stay in this hellhole division. |**68-46**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**0**| The Dodgers project of acquiring negative WAR trade deadline pieces has so far proven to be brilliant, with Rosario and Hernandez each proving their spots in the lineup. Lance Lynn has been great so far in his two starts, providing a quality start in each (although one was against the A's). The Dodgers team seems to be a lot happier and on a great trajectory to finish the season. |**64-46**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| We got JV back and mostly took care of business against the Yankees. That's a good week. It's still a bit annoying that we didn't just sign Verlander in the offseason instead of trading prospects for him, but I suppose since I am not Jim Crane's golfing buddy, I don't understand these things. |**64-49**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| I'm writing this on Saturday (because we're going on a camping trip tomorrow), following what I'll assume will be a win completing the sweep of Boston after, say, Jarren Duran trips over a wayward pelican in the outfield or some equally ridiculous way to blow a game. Hopefully that makes up for pooping our pants vs Baltimore. The Jays are starting to round into form, with reinforcements coming via trade and injury rehab, but the continued RISP woes, particularly vs AL East teams, remains a concern. Having said that, once Jordan Romano, Trevor Richards, and Chad Green are back from the IL soon, this bullpen looks absolutely filthy, and our rotation (6-deep now with Ryu back) is in great shape, with two ace seasons from Gausman and Berrios and even Manoah looking better game by game. Decisions will have to be made once we're out of this 17-in-17 stretch. Guys like Springer, Kirk, and Varsho are actually looking like they're coming to life at the plate (now do Vladdy), but our new hero is a 4-foot-nothin, mustachioed, powerhouse dirtbag kid named Davis Schneider. Whacked a HR over the Green Monster in his very first MLB AB, and seems to be sparking this roster with his youth and enthusiasm and mustacheness. The next month's schedule is quite friendly, let's see if we can do something with it. At Cleveland and home for the Cubbies this week.  |**63-50**
**8**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| The Giants took 3 of 4 from AZ and dropped 2 to the As for a 3-3 week of essentially all close games. It couldve been better; it couldve been worse. Losing twice to Oakland is unfortunate, but that match-up is historically a coin flip. The middle of the IF is healthy with Estrada and Crawford back, (struggling Schmitt to AAA), Yaz out till late August and Disco likely done for the season is the major roster news. Sure might have been nice to acquire some starting pitching help right about now, but offense D E P T H was the focus with now Pollock and Mathias in the majors. I said last week a 3-3 week would be fine so Im contractually disallowed from complaining. Lets go to the numbers: 13th in MLB in Run Diff (+1 spot), 18th in RS/G (-2), 9th in RA/G (=), 6th in Bullpen ERA (+1). The Giants need to hit and they need to hit now. Next up: 6 vs the ALW. @ LAA and vs TEX. I suggest everyone come out to the park on the 11th to welcome Bochy backIll be there. |**61-51**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+4**| What an eventful week it was for Trea Turner and the Phillies. They started the week winning 3/4 in Miami against the divison/wild card rival Marlins, but there was a slightly sour taste in the mouths of the fans because that one loss was a Trea Turner mistake away from being a win. Turner apologized and took the blame. When the team came back to Philly for a 3 game set against the Royals, Turner received a standing ovation. Despite this, the Phillies lost the first game and were losing in the 2nd. In a season-defining moment, Trea Turner hit a 3-run come from behind home run in the 6th inning, a game that the Phillies would hold on to win and also win the next day. The team is now 10 games over .500 and tied for the first wild card spot, with a Trea Turner resurgance hopefully on the horizon. |**61-51**
**10**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+7**|  |**60-52**
**11**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+7**| As the days of summer continue to pass, the Cubs continue to pile up wins. With a 5-2 week against the Reds and Braves, the Cubs are currently in possession of the final NL Wild Card spot and 1.5 games behind the Brewers for the NL Central lead. The offense continues to be scorching hot, and trade acquisition Jeimer Candelario has been a relevation. While the pitching staff has been solid most of the season, it is suddenly looking a lot thinner with Marcus Stroman's trip to the IL with a hip issue. The Cubs will need him to get back into form to cement their place as a playoff team. |**58-54**
**12**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| I read an article that essentially said that ""The Brewers basically went to Costco at the deadline and loaded up on bulk goods""  I'm still laughing at that because it's exactly true.  Milwaukee didn't do anything flashy or fancy, but they acquired things to fill same gaping holes (worst DH production in MLB) and things that are always good like a swing and miss lefty reliever (Andrew Chafin) |**60-53**
**13**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+6**| A nice rebound week with a 4 game win streak so far. The lineup seems to be finally putting things together (again) and the sky is no longer falling like last week. |**59-54**
**14**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+2**| Taking 3/4 from Houston would have been huge for this team. Taking 2/4 though is&.fine. The bats did largely look better, but now pitching is a massive question mark (if it wasn't already). Nestor looked Nasty, but German is done, Severino looks shot, and Carlos Rodon has been underwhelming to say the least. Oh and he's hurt again, so, you know, signing is just looking terrific so far. Shades of Carl Pavano? I'm not there yet, but still, yikes.  |**58-54**
**15**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-5**| Aaaaand with that, back to our regularly scheduled programming of ~.500 ball. With this rotation, it's not like we were going anywhere, but I'll admit I got caught up in the WC race hype a bit. Despite faceplanting as soon as we wrapped up our trades, I'm still happy with our deadline moves. Luis Urias was a STEAL, and with team control through '25, we don't have to worry about middle infield depth for a bit. The farm is great, the rookies keep improving, and the future is bright in Boston. |**57-54**
**16**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**-7**| Okay guys, things are fine. Sure weve lost 6 in a row and the entire team looks like theyve given up despite it being August, but things are fine. I dont know how theyre fine, I just need to believe theyre fine. Thats all. Things are not falling apart, everything is okay. Please remain calm, do not panic, do not worry. Is this convincing enough? I dont know if its convincing enough, Im not good at crisis management. My solution to getting a divorce was crying in the aisle of a Kroger while buying cereal, Im not that great at managing problems. Like what else am I to say? The entire team sucks right now. And this is beyond the manager at this point, if you honestly and fully believe right now that David Bell is to blame for our problems, then I legitimately dont know how to help you. What do you honestly want the manager to do when the ENTIRE team cant hit with RISP to save their lives? Things are bad, hopefully when Jonathan India, Hunter Greene, and Nick Lodolo return thatll rejuvenate the team, maybe even a September call-up of Noelvi Marte could do the trick. Otherwise, things are looking glum in Reds country. Operation Red October is officially in crisis. The Capitalists are winning. |**59-55**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+3**| Kim and Soto lead the way in the Pads lineup, being the most consistent hitters from July on. SD really cannot afford to lose again today. Though they've been inching closer in the WC standings, upcoming games against the M's, D-Backs, and O's all look tough. All eyes fall on Lugo for the day game, as the Pads try to avoid losing 3 of 4 to LA, at home.  |**55-57**
**18**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-6**| Nothing is going right for the Diamondbacks.  |**57-56**
**19**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-5**| The return of eury better save us. Pitching has gone to hell but at least bell and burger have been hittin dingers. skip needs to adjust his pitching management, cuz leaving a pitcher like weathers out there for as long as he did was bs. We got the reds and yanks this week. |**58-55**
**20**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-5**| The speed with which things blew up after the Angels tried going all-out with what little they could at the trade deadline is a pretty good puncuation mark for the Ohtani Era.  |**56-57**
**21**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| What an embarrassing week. We got swept by the trashcan, including a no-hitter. Then we lost 2 of 3 to the White Sox and our players embarrassed themselves by clearing the benches and getting in a fight with the White Sox players in one game, and then the next day, we were up by one run in the ninth and then ended losing by three. Hopefully this week is better, but the bar is on the floor. Also, what the hell happened to the Rays and the Diamondbacks?  |**54-58**
**22**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+2**| The Pirates had a pretty low-key deadline, sending out Rich Hill, Ji-man Choi, Austin Hedges and Rodolfo Castro for a couple pitchers and low-level prospects. The trades were mostly fine, although I will miss Hill, Choi, and even Castro (Hedges could not have left soon enough). It's once again time to play the kids, and so far the results have been kind of okay? The Bucs split series with the Tigers and Brewers this week  not bad  but I'm worried how they'll fare against Atlanta (think of that ""Hydrogen Bomb v. Coughing Baby"" meme) |**50-61**
**23**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| The Jets opened their preseason slate with the Hall of Fame Game this past Thursday with a 21-16 loss to the Browns in Canton, Ohio. Notable highlights from that game included a very nice deep ball from Zach Wilson and a rushing TD from Pitt product Israel Abanikanda. The Jets will head to Carolina on Saturday afternoon for their first ""normal' preseason game of the year. In the meantime, you'll also be able to see them on the season premiere of HBO's Hard Knocks, this Tuesday at 10pm Eastern. |**50-61**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-1**| Mozeliak's deadline trades are getting some positive commenting. They do look pretty good, they'd have been more fruitful if at least a couple (DeJong, Flaherty) happened years ago. Mo still bad, fire everyone, etc. |**49-64**
**25**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Things that separate the 2023 Nationals from the 2023 Mets: **1.5 games** and **$250,890,440** |**49-63**
**26**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-1**| So..... yeah.... Eduardo Rodriguez. This is awkward. Maybe he doesn't use his opt-out in exchange for having another year or two tacked onto his contract, but the deal with LA that fell through will really hurt if he walks at the end of the season and Detroit only gets a comp pick. This week: 4 vs. MIN, 3 at BOS. |**49-62**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| I have no words. Every day when I think it can't get worse, it does. This organization is rotted to the core and it will never change until Jerry Reinsdorf is no longer in charge. |**45-68**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| **No Blurb Submitted** |**44-67**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**|  |**36-77**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| If the a's were somehow able to trade Jace Peterson and Fuji, but not Laureano, that tells you how much Ramon has fallen on hard times. One of my friends said the a's were dfa'ing their only known player- which could be true I guess, but that speaks to an important element- the best , and most enjoyable, a's teams are the ones where you haven't heard of anyone. Who is this Jordan Diaz kid, on a 30 HR pace? What is Zack Gelof doing with a 30% K rate and 142 wRC+ in his first month? Ruiz is back stealing bases and inexplicably Nick Allen had a two HR game on Sunday. The team is still bad, but things are clearly happening in Oakland, potentially for the last time.   |**32-80**","baseball",83,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15kx84m/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_19_orioles/"

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| I have no superlatives to say, the Rays' record(s) speak for themselves in their continued historic start. They haven't looked completely invulnerable as they were forced into back-to-back walk-off wins against the White Sox courtesy of Brandon ""Dawg Haver"" Lowe and Randy ""Him"" Arozarena. Springs was confirmed to need TJ surgery, which has been the only real negative so far. The Rays face a challenge this week with the Astros coming to town, but with a 153 wRC+ as a team and nearly double the HRs as the median team, confidence is sky high. |**19-3**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| First off, I apologize for missing last week. Had some unexpected family stuff come up. Believe me I wish I was able to talk about how great we were doing last week compared to what happened over the weekend. After winning 8 games in a row, the Braves have now dropped 4 in a row capped off by being swept in the TP. Not great, especially because of how our bullpen really struggled over the weekend. That was heartbreaking. This team is streakier than your dad's underwear. |**14-8**
**3**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+1**| Rookie CF Garrett Mitchell was off to a solid start this season after being on fire in his 28 MLB games last year.   Bad news is that he will most likely miss the rest of the season due to should surgery after an injury in Seattle. (Which unfortunately I saw, fortunately I saw it in the new Press Club section which is absolutely incredible).    The other key rookies Brice Turang (2B) and Joey Wiemer (OF) are killing it defensively.  This is a fun team to watch |**15-7**
**4**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-1**| The Yankees lost their first series of the season, dropping 2/3 to the Blue Jays, and the Bombers have been doing anything but dropping bombs. The top of the order has gone ice cold, and with Stanton and Bader still hurt, itll be a while before any fresh bats come in. Despite the injuries to the rotation, pitching is still holding up well, but 23rd in runs scored isnt gonna cut it not in this division.  |**13-9**
**5**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+4**| Stop pitching to Yordan. Also, who is Jose Altuve, anyway? This Dubon guy is way better. |**12-10**
**6**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| The Mets head home after finishing their strong West Coast trip taking 2 of 3 from the Dodgers and splitting a 4-gamer with the Giants. They will be without the services of Max Scherzer this week, but it may not matter due to the return of everyone's favorite Italian-American and churve enthusiast, Joey Lucchesi. Justin Verlander's return also looms in early May, potentially lining up for a return to Comerica Park for his Mets debut. |**14-9**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| Stellar week from the starting rotation, as all five guys turned in top-tier performances (33.1 IP, 4 ER, 28 K, 5 BB combined over the last 5 games) to take series from TB and NYY, but also suffering two big losses at HOU. As usual, the bullpen manages to blow big spots and lose winnable matchups. The offense is starting to produce top to bottom, and Vladdy just showed that he's able to turn Yankee boos into HRs that can cure erectile dysfunction (talk to your doctor or Aaron Boone if one lasts longer than 4 hours). The only issue has been historically bad RISP numbers, which should hopefully regress to the norm soon and let us make up some ground against a scorching hot Rays team.  |**13-9**
**8**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+4**| All praise the PEAGLE! |**14-7**
**9**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| Forgive my baseless musings for a moment, but what if this Mookie Betts shortstop thing is more than just a novelty? In his very short time there so far, he looks at the very least comfortable, and while we haven't seen nearly enough to conclude whether or not he's actually good there defensively, I wouldn't put it past Mookie of all people to just pull high quality shortstop defense out of the air. I understand why some baseball people may be instinctively pulling their hair out at the idea of a six-time gold glover playing out of position, but with the way these Dodgers are constructed, a corner outfielder is easier to replace than a shortstop. It helps when you have James Outman, too.  |**12-11**
**10**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+6**| Last week I raved about the Orioles offense and loathed the pitching. Maybe they read this ranking because they went out this week and were all great. A total of 3 runs given up in 5 games this week. They won all of them, although the offense is now really struggling. It'll click for the entire team at some point. It is just nice to see that we have the hitting and the pitching (so far) that makes us a legitimate threat to make the postseason. Also don't yell at me for putting the Pirates #1, no one thought they would do anything this year so for them to have the best record in the NL so far through 20+ games, they deserve it. |**14-7**
**11**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-4**| That was a weird and lackluster 2-4 week. We lost one game because of Fenway Pesky Pole weirdness, and another against the Nats because freezing sleet came down for 20 minutes so none of our pitchers had any control while the Nats took the lead. Also our bats have still not woken up. Our pitching is still holding solid though, and we'll need every bit of it this week as the Yankees make the trip to Minneapolis. |**12-10**
**12**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-2**| Fuck John J Fisher, and any owner who does everything possible to alienate their city and fans, and then shrugs and acts like they tried their best to stay. Relocation sucks. On a Pads note, great to have Tatis back, and see the bats pick up a bit in the series in AZ. Boagarts is on a streak of getting on base every game this season, it actually extends to his last 3 games with the Red Sox, I believe. Despite a somewhat 'meh' start to the season, the Pads are still in a good spot, only a half game out of the West lead. |**12-12**
**13**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+8**| Folks, you really are hearing it more and more  people across this great nation, in bars and coffee shops, in grocery stores and at bus stops, they cannot stop talking about the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Bucs currently own the best record in the National League thanks to a perfect 7-0 record this week; they dropped 33 runs in 3 games on the Rockies, and then allowed just 6 runs in 4 games against the Reds. This is the Pirates' best start since 1992, which was the last time they won a division title. Unlike that year, however, this year's Pirates may never lose again. |**16-7**
**14**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**0**| The Good this week: Cody Bellinger, Drew Smyly, Justin Steele, Patrick Wisdom. The Bad: Michael Fulmer, Tucker Barnhart, First Base, Marcus Stroman against the Dodgers. The ugly: The bullpen, David Ross' lineup decisions . This week: 3 against the Padres and 3 against the Marlins |**12-9**
**15**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-4**| The Guardians played the Tigers and the Marlins this week. I thought they should sweep both those teams, or at least win 2/3 in each series. Instead, they lost two in each series. Very disappointing. I should have learned from the Athletics and Nationals series. Maybe this isn't our year. I'm worried about this team. |**11-11**
**16**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-1**| The Diamondbacks had an okay week, taking two of three in St. Louis before dropping three games out of four at home to Tatis and the Padres. The good news is that Madison Bumgarner is no longer the Snakes' problem; the bad news is that the starting pitching appears to be, at the very least, a question going forward. I think it's a matter of time before Merrill Kelly rights himself, but 3/5 of the rotation going forward will be rookies or almost-rookies. |**12-11**
**17**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-4**| The M's closed out their homestand with a winning record, though as has become all too common thus far, sloppiness is consistently getting in their way. Teo looks to be bouncing back from his early struggles, while Kolten... not so much (He did have a 3-hit night last night, but that was surrounding an error which left runners on for a 3-run shot immediately after, so yeah.)  Up next: 3 @ Liberty Bells, 3 @ Rogers Centre East (not to be confused with Rogers Center West, which will happen later in the year) |**10-12**
**18**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+1**| The Phillies won games they were supposed to! They took 2/3 from the White Sox and 3/4 from the Rockies. The bullpen was absolutely lockdown this week, with 2 earned runs coming in one game from minor pieces, while the key pieces locked it down. The aces of the rotation still haven't looked like their true selves, but there's improvement. The offense probably should've done more than 4 runs per game against the Rockies, but wins are wins. Brandon Marsh still leads the league in OPS while Nick Castellanos is on pace to hit 70 doubles with a career high OBP. The offense will hopefully fully unlock with the fast approaching return of Bryce Harper. This week, 3 at home against the Mariners before heading to Houston for a rematch of last year's World Series against houston. |**11-12**
**19**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+1**| 2023 may be a historic year for the AL East. When playing non-divisional opponents, they have a .705 win percentage, which is ~114 wins over the course of a full season. The Sox have looked good over the last week, Masataka finally broke out, Devers keeps slugging, but despite this the team has fallen another 1.5 games behind Tampa. Unless the starting pitching improves quick, 5th place is where this team is staying. |**12-11**
**20**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-2**| Losing Logan O'Hoppe for the remainder of the season, or close to it anyway, is nothing short of a massive blow for the team. Logan to this point had been a full blown boon for the latter part of the lineup, but the catching duties will now fall to the third and fouth men on the depth chart, Chad Wallach and Matt Thaiss. Both guys stepped up well over the weekend with some clutch home runs. If they can at the very least combine to make for one average hitter in the lineup, the team would more than take that.  |**11-11**
**21**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-4**|**NO BLURB SUBMITTED**  |**9-13**
**22**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| Not gonna lie, the way the marlins have been gradually improving their approach at the plate has low key impressed me. They don't have eye popping power numbers and LOB issues are still present but it's steady creeping up. Also shout-out to AJ Puk, fuckin 9th inning assassin. On an unrelated note, jazz is doing just fine in CF. We got 4 in the A followed by a three game series at home against the cubs this weekend. |**12-10**
**23**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-1**| Joc is BACK, Haniger / Slater return today?, and Alex Wood is out several weeks. I shouldve led with the bad news. The Giants have won two in a row, three of their last five, and that is not biased data selection. The standings may not make fans happy, but splitting a series vs the talented Mets is good. This is a tough stretch, and the Giants need to get out of it playing roughly .500 ball. Taylor Rogers is improving, which is fantastic, and the Giants bullpen is now 27th in ERA, up 1 spot! -14 in Run Diff, 1-3 1 Run Games, 1-2 in Extras  the numbers suggest the Giants record deserves to be *slightly* better. Down to 17th in MLB in RS / G, fans can hope for a boost with a fully operational lineup. However, 24th in RA / G will sink any team. Fangraphs has the staff giving up a FULL RUN less per game over the course of 2023. So, weve got that going for us, which is nice. Next is 4 vs the suddenly struggling Cards and then @ Padres. The Giants need to win 3-4 of these games. |**8-13**
**24**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| 22 games in, the White Sox have yet to win 2 games back to back. This team is flat out bad in the most boring way. They don't do anything well. They're not unlucky (8th highest xFIP and 15th ranked BABIP). They have the 2nd worst ERA in the league. Their wRC+ is just below average 97. They also have the 2nd lowest launch angle in the league to go along with the 6th worst hard hit ball%. It's boring, uninspired baseball that, frankly, I don't even want to watch anymore. |**7-15**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| I went to my Grandmothers house a few days ago, she was wanting to drop Dish and switch to a streaming service. Now shes in her 70s, and Im the go-to tech guy in my family because I know what a RAM is. First thing we needed was a box, I went with a Roku since its interface is simple enough to understand. I spent about 10 minutes on the floor under the entertainment center hooking everything up. I set up an account, and set up connection. Now, her internet only went to 5 megabits,  not nearly good enough to stream. So I told her shed need faster internet. She paid $50 a month for that 5 Mbps, borderline theft. I called another company, I waited on hold for 20 minutes to reach a sales rep. I got to the wrong department. I was transferred and waited on hold for 15 minutes. Finally got to someone, chose an option, and I had to wait on hold in silence for 10 minutes while they did god knows what. I decided to set it up for her until the technician came in a few days. A few days later the tech finished, I came down to her house, aaaaand the internet wasn't working. Call up the company, another 20 minute hold to get to tech support, and 45 minutes of trying to explain what the problem was. Finally got everything working and it was time to set up a TV service. She wanted FUBO since they had Bally. I got her an account, and after a total of 2 hours and 10 minutes since arriving at her house, everything was ready. The first thing she did was switch to Bally. The channel that was reason she spent an extra $40 a month to use Fubo instead of Sling. The Reds were losing 7-0 in the 4th inning. She then sighed and changed the channel to the Food Network, where some people were decorating cakes. The Reds have now lost 6 in a row and are 1-7 in 1 run games. Sell the team Bob. |**7-15**
**26**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+1**| A team slash line of .209/.270/,327 isn't very good, is it? Finding consistent hitting has been near impossible this year as the team has stuggled with President Scott Harris's Control the Strike Zone mantra. So here we are, 7-13 and looking ahead to a tough week with 3 at Milwaukee and 4 vs. Baltimore.  |**7-13**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+2**| The Nationals went 2-3 over the last week against the O's and the Twins and if you had guaranteed me that the Nats would take a series from the Twins, I would have told you to swallow a hotdog whole. Somehow Jaimer Candelario is looking very servicable and Stone Garrett is leading the team in batting average. Mason Thompson continues to pitch well out of the pen and Patrick Qorbin continues to lower his ERA with the hope of getting it under 5 for the first time since Covid-19 (which he probably still doesn't believe in). |**7-14**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-2**| Fun fact: The Rockies are the only team that hasn't won a World Series that also hasn't ever had the first-overall pick in the draft.  The 2023 Rockies are on pace to be the worst Rockies team in franchise history and, thanks to the Royals and As, aren't even in line to get their first first-overall draft pick.  They're not even good at being bad. |**6-17**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**-1**| I'm not entirely sure that I understand the Royals. We knew they were going to be mediocre at best this year, but it seemed like they were trying to be somewhat competitive. Thus far, the A's are the only thing keeping them out of the basement. Bubic had a chance to be a great story and is gone until sometime in 2024. At least Chapman could be a trade chip. |**5-17**

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| The Rays are still undefeated, but due to a clerical error involving Canadian conversion rates MLB is incorrectly reporting a couple games. It should be fixed shortly. The first big setback of the season occurred when Jeffrey Springs left early with an elbow injury, but top prospect Taj Bradley had a pretty nice debut so it evens out I guess? Wander Franco has started out on an 11 fWAR pace with Lowe and Lowe (prounounced in that order) close behind. The Rays also have a 151 wRC+ as a team, next best is 126. Sustainability? I agree it should be a key value to preserve our environment, but why are you bringing that up in a baseball forum? |**14-2**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**+1**|  |**12-4**
**3**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-1**| The Yankees won the week again, but at 4-3 it was a little more rocky than usual. Cole, whos an absolute FRAWG, and Cortes, who remains incredibly consistent, are still the only two healthy starters this team can rely on. Jhony Brito had a good first two outings, but got full-on butt-blasted against the Twins. Hes a rookie, it happens, but *yeesh*. Oh, and Stantons hurt again but that should surprise no one.  |**10-6**
**4**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+3**| Losing a series to the D-Backs was not a good way to start the west coast road trip, but taking 3/4 from the Padres more than salvages it.  It's felt like Milwaukee has been getting on base a lot, reading an article on The Athletic this morning confirmed my feeling.  ""Through Sunday, the Brewers were walking to first base more often than every team but one, the Dodgers, with a walk rate of 12.6 percent"" |**11-5**
**5**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+6**| ""The Mets come off of a very strong week, taking 2 out of 3 from the Padres and sweeping the A's. Brett Baty is coming up to ideally fortify a lineup that never seems to remember you're actually allowed to get multiple hits in a row. Francisco Alvarez hasn't provided the immediate spark some hoped to see - a nice gesture to sports radio hosts who have nothing else to complain about since the Knicks, Nets, Rangers, Isles, and Devils all made the playoffs this year."" |**10-6**
**6**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+2**| The Jays are starting to look like a much more solid, complete team on the backs of gem starts from Jose Berrios and Yusei Kikuchi, as we all thought, and despite clunkers from a wobbly Alek Manoah. It's essentially a very specific witch's curse two of our rotation must pitch like they spent the night prior drinking with Pete Rose. BUT I DIGRESS. We did right by Buttercup Dickerson, Sleeper Sullivan, and the rest of the 1884 St. Louis Maroons by stopping the Rays' season-opening win streak at 13. We won the series in the process, making that four straight series wins behind stellar top-of-the-lineup batting, especially by Bo Bichette, who's turned into an oppo-hit machine. If this rotation could stabilize, that'd be great, especially with a big road trip at the Astros and Yankees on deck this week. |**10-6**
**7**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+2**| An excellent 4-2 week! It's always fun winning a series against the White Sox, but we also managed a 2-2 split against the Yankees! In New York! While wearing uniforms that say ""Twins!"" Minnesota's Yankee PTSD is still there, but this may be an early sign that we can hang around with top teams and won't be intimidated. |**10-6**
**8**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-3**|  |**8-8**
**9**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-3**| The Astros look rough so far. Not really much else to say. Of all people, Mauricio Dubon is one of the top bats we can trust right now. For this week's wild overreaction, Hunter Brown may legitimately be the second coming of Jesus - Justin Verlander. |**7-9**
**10**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| Last year, the Guardians defied the odds, won their division and came within a game of the ALCS. So I came into this season super optimistic. Instead, I've watched them struggle against the Athletics and Nationals, and most of their wins have been by one run. The Yankees also embarrassed them at home this week, and the Twins look really good. You'd think I would have learned by now. |**9-7**
**11**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-7*| The Padres have already played all three NL division leaders, and have upcoming series's against the East and West leaders again before week's end. Of course to what extent would these teams be leading their divisions if they didn't play the Padres? I'm not sure, but it certainly feels like the Pads have been going from one tough spot to the next. The lack of offense has been well documented, culminating in a shutout loss that ruined a 12K, 7inning effort from Yu Darvish. Tatis is scheduled to come back on thursday, and will hopefully provide a boost to the lineup.  |**8-9**
**12**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+3**| A series win in Houston for the first time since 2018 is a great way to end the week. A strong start to the season has this team with a little momentum even with injuries to Seagar and Garver that will have them missing some time. It's great that money really can buy happiness. I'm typing this right before the City Connect reveal, here is to hoping they are not trash. |**9-6**
**13**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+1**| Tomorrow is the tax deadline, but even more important than that, it's the deadline to send in your official Jarred Kelenic apology forms. Please send them to T-Mobile Park, 1250 1st Ave S, Seattle, WA 98134.   The M's went 4-2 in a week where they could realistically have gone 6-0 if not for some... unfortunate meltdowns. The interleague marathon continues this week, and given the M's extremely dissapointing results from the DH spot this year it almost makes me wish that universal DH didn't become a thing (almost.) Up next: 3 vs. Beers, 3 vs. The Spirit of St. Louis |**8-8**
**14**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+6**| Another good week for the Cubs, driven by excellent starting pitching: Cubs starters had a 2.40 ERA in 30 IP, and Justin Steele  is off to an extremely hot start. Combined with timely hitting from accross the lineup, they won series against the Mariners and Dodgers. The only source of concern is 1B, where Eric Hosmer has been subpar and Trey Mancini downright awful. The schedule eases up with a 3 game set with the A's, before a 4 game set with the Dodgers in Chicago. |**8-6**
**15**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+2**| **NO BLURB SUBMITTED** |**9-7**
**16**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+3**| 94 runs scored, good for 2nd in MLB. 87 runs against, good for bottom 5 in MLB. 22 HRs so far, good for 6th in MLB. 22 HRs against, good for bottom 5 in MLB. 24 SBs, good for 2nd in MLB. 2 Quality Starts, good for next to last in MLB. The Orioles optioned Cole Irvin, one of two pitchers they picked up in the offseason to AAA after 3 starts and an ERA over 10. As you can see the offense is fine, the pitching is terrible. I know the bullpen regressed a little and are also missing a couple of people on the IL, however the starters continue to not go 5+ innings and the Orioles are playing from behind almost every game. The great thing about the offense this year...the introduction of the Dong Bong, you're welcome. |**9-7**
**17**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-4**| Positives: Nolan Gorman, a 4-3 week, the bats generally looking better. Negatives: Still kinda everything, but it's April and bumpy starts happen |**7-9**
**18**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-6**| The Angels have had a lead in every game this season with the exception of their 11-2 loss to Seattle. The offense, by and large, has been doing its job. They are 8th in runs per game, 12th in wRC+, and 13th in wOBA. While there is some level of frustration to be had with the offense producing early in games and disappearing late, the story of the season so far has largely just been the pitching's inability to hold on to the leads they have been spotted. |**7-8**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-3**| The Phillies lost 2/3 to the Marlins and split a 4 game series against the Reds. It's just been that kind of season. Bryson Stott is on a 16 game hitting streak to start the year, while Brandon Marsh leads the league in OPS. The offense hasn't been statistically terrible: they're 4th in Average and 5th in Slugging, and yet are 25th in runs scored. The pitching doesn't have any caveat and has just been bad. Despite blowing a save against the Marlins, Jose Alvarado is continuing to be one of the most dominant pitchers in the league, with 16 Ks in 6 1/3 innings, allowing 0 walks and 4 hits, one of those being a home run. This week: 3 in the South Side before heading back home to take on the Rockies in 4.  |**6-10**
**20**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| I swear this team is going to give me whiplash. With a win today, the Sox will have alternated getting swept/sweeping four series in a row. There are some signs of life, but too much of this team is underperforming hard to get particularly excited. The starting staff can strike out opponents, but have zero control and give up meatballs constantly. There are a lot of intriguing hitters in our lineup, but too many of them are slumping hard at the moment. At least we're still .500 |**8-8**
**21**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+2**| It's a weird feeling when the Pirates get a split in St. Louis and it almost feels like a letdown. The four games played at Busch this weekend felt like a classic series from 2013-2015, full of wild swings, great escapes, and big hits. The Pirates offense is certainly missing Oneil Cruz, although Andrew McCutchen has proven to be more worth more than nostalgia  he's hitting .298/.426/.489 to start the year and hit a 2-run, go-ahead homer in Saturday's win. The real difference this week, though, was the rotation, which has now made 6 straight quality starts. |**9-7**
**22**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-1**| You know whats up with the Giants when youre happy the game was canceled yesterday. Weve had one cancelation, yes, but what about 2nd cancellation? All told, the Giants went 1  4 during a week they should have been 3  2. What sucks? The giving up runs part. What am I happiest about? That I havent given the Giants any money yet.  Look for both things to change as the pitching isnt actually this bad and I want a Doval or discount Belt shirsey. Dropping to a -6 Run Diff, the Giants come in at 10th in RS / G and 24th in RA / G. The bullpen has the 3rd worst ERA in baseball  theyre walking a lot of people, they strike out a good amount, and they give up shit tons of homeruns. Not great, Bob. Its time to find out who the Giants are, and the upcoming schedule will show us @MIA, vs Mets, Cardinals Padres, @Hou, vs Brewers. Thats a lot of good teams. |**5-9**
**23**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| Arraez is a hitting god and no one can tell me otherwise. First cycle in marlins history and not a single person who has been watching the marlins this season was surprised it was him. His batting average is .471 and we're in the third week of the season, fingers crossed that he continues. on the pitching side, Sandy's troubles continue but Cabrera and Rogers look to be improving. The fish have the giants at home followed by the guardians on the road this week. |**8-8**
**24**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-2**| 16 games into the season and the White Sox have yet to win a single series. Any hopes that a new manager would be able to bring out some new vibes for the club are quickly disappearing. They are undisciplined, as evidenced by 3rd and 2nd worst walk rates for hitters and pitchers respectively. This team is a chore to watch which is very disappointing for a team that, if nothing else, should be at least fun. |**6-10**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| I'm very thankful for the chance to represent the Reds, I've always wanted an outlet for my suffering. Mediocrity is all us Reds fans have experienced under the regimes of Lindner and the Castellini's and there does not appear to be an end. Many fans are optimistic because ""the prospects though"", which just makes me feel a sense of deja vu because I've heard this so many times. But hey, until the inevitable sadness drops in a couple years we can still focus on today. The team is finally starting to hit consistently, whether due to the rule changes, ball changes, or the fact that Alan Zinter is not hereand I think we have a very legitimate ROTY candidate in Spencer Steer, and the top 3 in the rotation have potential to be a truly devastating bunch. But once again for the umpteenth year in a row the bullpen is the thing that I'm going to blame as my reason for needing therapy.  |**6-9**
**26**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| Oh, you wanna know how the Rockies did this week?  They did bad.  Very bad.  They went 1-5 and got absolutely destroyed by the Mariners in a series they got outscored by the Ms 15-5.  They also blew leads in both games they lost to the Cardinals.  The only bright side I see this week is that Noah Davis didn't get hurt on that comebacker that knocked his hat off. |**5-11**
**27**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+2**| Five-plus hour rain delay turned into postponement on Sunday debacle aside, it was a fun latter half of the week with Nick Maton and Miguel Cabrera going back to back on walkoff knocks in the 11th on Friday and Saturday, respectively. This week: 3 vs. CLE; 3 at BAL. |**5-9**
**28**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**-1**| At least the A's exist, keeping the Royals from the last spot based on my formula. All of those well hit balls have led to zero production thus far. On the positive side, Kris Bubic looks like he might be taking the next step forward in his development and could join Brady Singer as a viable building block. Aroldis Chapman has been dominant and could be a solid trade chip. But the Royals, again, are heading for a forgettable season. |**4-12**
**29**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Victor Robles hit a snag this week but bounced back on Sunday with a hit, walk, and SB to help the Nats avoid a sweep from the Guardians. Ex-Padre prospects Mason Thompson and MacKenzie Gore have thrown well in the opening weeks with Thompson sporting a 1.59 ERA over 7 games and Gore holding a 3.00 ERA and a 2-0 record. Thompson's success is primarily due to throwing a lot more strikes with his bowling ball sinker/slider combo. |**5-11**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| A profoundly ironic despair captured me when I realized Hogan Harris was warming up in the pen. Harris, one of the more intruiging a's future relievers, was getting thrown into the fire for his debut after James Kaprielian walked five straight mets and gave up a grand slam. Harris is a high BB/K guy, and it seems like the A's built an entire pitching staff off those guys (ZJack, a top 10 reliever in baseball) (Fuji, who actually had a good start this week). They're betting on stuff over command, but boy can it get ugly. It did that Friday as Harris walked five dudes, and the Mets came close to breaking the all time record for most walks collected in a game where they were outhit by the a's (!). It's absurd how quicker the team turned around on offense but god will someone please throw strikes |**3-13**","baseball",57,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12pvyq9/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_3/"

#**#100 - Nathaniel Lowe - Texas Rangers [](/TEX) - First Baseman**

**Written by:** u/federalleaguemvp

Lowe evolved into one of the deadliest left handed hitters in baseball. Drafted in the 13th round by the Rays in 2016, the baseball world called him ""Nathan"" until his mother corrected the error on a Rangers pre-game show. Traded to Texas before the 2021 season, he played a full season and slashed .264/.357/.415 with a 114 wRC+. Not too shabby, you may say, but nowhere near worth mentioning here.

His silver slugger campaign in 2022 changed all that. Still playing for a bad team, Lowe improved to a .302/.358/.492 slash line with a 143 wRC+. A 3 fWAR season doesn't fully explain his hitting genius, since outs above average graded him as a -11 influence at 1B. That's ""drunken bear"" level of defense at what should be an easy position.

Nathaniel Lowe wallops the baseball like few other stars do and is not constrained by glaring weaknesses. Worried about breaking balls? He posted a .370 xwOBA off those pitches last season, which was fourth best in baseball. His .920 OPS vs. LHP as a lefty was second across the majors. Although his usefulness in the field may expire soon, I believe Lowe will be a feared power hitter for years to come.

#**#99 - Starling Marte - New York Mets [](/NYM) - Right Fielder**

**Written by:** u/federalleaguemvp

There's a special type of player that isn't hall of fame bound, but changes your perspective on baseball. Tossing excitement your way effortlessly, every little thing they do is magic and it makes you want to shout, ""look at this electrifying dude play some baseball"" to everyone around you paying attention. This is how I felt in the late summer and autumn of 2021 watching Starling Marte.

Previously he spent his career in the NL, going to all star games and somehow getting faster as he aged. In '21, the offensively flailing A's gave it one last go by giving up their big-hype prospect, Jesus Luzardo, for what amounted to be 55 games of Marte. From a value perspective? The trade was a failure. From an entertainment perspective? Ineffably worthwhile. He's 34 yet he steals bases even when you know he's going to run. For a guy with low hardhit% and launch angles, he uses his speed to churn out league average hitting seasons.

He reached his 2014 peak again in his early 30s, putting up 8.5 fWAR since the start of 2021. How does that happen? I don't know, it shouldn't! I could temper my biases and emotions and say ""Marte is on the decline phase of his career, and his .276-ish xba signifies he was to some degree lucky these last two years."" But screw it, the league just made it easier for him to steal bases and I highly recommend you open yourself up to Starling Marte. Because I believe he just might steal your heart.

#**#98 - Cedric Mullins - Baltimore Orioles [](/BAL) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** u/bluspy88

After a stellar 2021 season, Mullins turned in a solid if less spectacular performance in 2022, ending the year on a strong note after a slow start. When compared to his peers offensively, Mullins stands out as one of the better hitters at center field, and he showed flashes of the 30/30 season from the former campaign, hitting 16 homers and stealing 11 bases. Add to this production consistently reliable defense, and Baltimore has a great piece in one of the most valuable positions in baseball. Whether he can return to pushing towards becoming a top player in the entire league as he did two seasons ago will be the goal for 2023.
_____________

#**#97 - Luis Arraez - Minnesota Twins [](/MIN) - First Baseman**

**Written by:** u/federalleaguemvp

That's right folks, it's the 2022 Batting Champion Luis Arraez! Maybe you're already familiar with the man who struck out 43 times in 144 games, but did you know he's walked six more times than he's struck out across his career? Glimpses of brilliance poked out during his 2021 season, when he was a slightly above league average hitter. In his age-25 season, Arraez put the world on alert with a .316/.375/.420 slash line with a 131 wRC+.

Arraez does not hit the ball hard, ranked as one of the 10 worst qualified hitters in hard hit% and exit velocity markers. He makes magic out of simple contact with the baseball and it is those plate discipline numbers that are worth diving into. He's the best player in baseball at not whiffing at a pitch and avoiding K's. Arraez made contact with 94% of the baseball he got inside the zone! You better locate your fastball if you're facing Arraez, since he only whiffed at the pitch 5.8% of the time in '22.

There's no specific pitch weakness in Arraez's game and his skill-set should age well going forward. The lack of barrel's may scare some, but 2022 proved there is a place on this list for Luis Arraez and his contact prowess.

#**#96 - Ke'Bryan Hayes - Pittsburgh Pirates [](/PIT) - Third Baseman**

In 2022, Ke'Bryan Hayes hit .244 and slugged .345 with a career high seven home runs. So what on earth is he doing on this list? Well, for starters, the 25-year-old is one of the best defensive players in baseball, racking up a major league leading 24 defensive runs saved and easily passing the eye test with his play at the hot corner. Despite a mediocre 88 wRC+, he was good for 3 wins above replacement per Fangraphs, rewarding the Pirates's faith in him after they inked him to an 8-year contract extension (which now looks like a surplus-value heist). That's worth inclusion.

But here's the thingwhat if you added offense back into the equation? In the minors, Hayes ascended high up prospect lists on the strength of not just elite defense, but good plate skills and scalding exit velocities that led evaluators to dream of a possible swing change cutting down on the groundballs and unlocking his latent power. And then, when the Pirates called him up in 2020, he stroked .376/.442/.682 for a 195 wRC+, racking up 1.7 fWAR in just 24 games. He hasn't lived up to that in the two seasons since, but the underlying K/BB skills and healthy hard hit rates are still present. If Hayes finds a more consistent power stroke, this ranking could look hilariously low next year. If not, well, ""best defensive third baseman in baseball"" (Nolan who?) is still pretty good, and he's sure to be a cornerstone in Pittsburgh for years to come.

#**#95 - Corbin Carroll - Arizona Diamondbacks [](/ARI) - Left Fielder**

**Written by:** u/Lars9

I am significantly higher than consensus, ranking Carroll at 33rd overall. Technically he's still a prospect and still at least in my opinion the number 1 prospect in baseball. He's an elite defender with elite speed, with a 60 hit tool and good pop. He played in 93 games across 3 minor league levels in 2022 he slashed .307/.425/.611, hitting 24 HRs. In 32 MLB games he slashes .360/.330/.500 with 4 HRs, all while just 21 years old and coming off a lost season with a shoulder injury. I have zero questions about Carroll's ability to get on base and play the field, those 2 parts of his game make him a high floor player. The question will be whether he hits for enough power to be an elite MLB player - I expect him to be able to and think he will be a household name a year from now.

#**#94 - Ozzie Albies - Atlanta Braves [](/ATL) - Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/SeeYaLaterDylan

Ozzie Albies lost the majority of his 2022 season because of a fluky broken foot on a foul ball. He returned for two games in September just to somehow break his pinky finger. That much time lost impacted the collective perception of him as a whole, although a rebound 2023 seems in order,  just like his clubhouse buddy Ronald Acuña Jr. Albies, a two-time All-Star just weeks away from his 26th birthday, is a strange player to watch sometimes. He uses what looks like two completely different batting stances from each side of the plate, and hell try to golf at pitches he has no business even entertaining. But he churns out extra-base hits and provides considerable value on defense and on the basepaths, adding up to a consistently valuable second baseman. 

Also, say hi to [Ozzie](https://i.imgur.com/ZH33CUe.jpg), my cat.

#**#93 - Nick Lodolo - Cincinnati Reds [](/CIN) - Left-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/FederalLeagueMVP

The lean lefty from TCU methodically climbed up the minor league ladder, finishing his rookie year in '22. Totaling 131 K's in 103 IP this season, Lodolo made his home in one of the toughest pitcher parks in the country. He did so with a four pitch mix, accentuated with a devastating sweeper curveball with 40 inches of drop. He also thrives on locating his change-up and sinker well, culminating with a fastball spin rate in the 75th percentile. There were three pitchers last year with more than a 29% K and 45% GB rates; Nick Lodolo was the youngest.

His lower arm angle gives him a menacing look on the mound, partially explaining his 3.29 SIERA last season. After losing the Field of Dreams game in August, he notched back to back starts with 11 K's in the next month and only gave up 10 ER's in his final 6 starts. This isn't just first round pedigree- the league can not afford to take a lodolo for free.

#**#92 - Nico Hoerner - Chicago Cubs [](/CHC) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/Bnavis

When he was drafted in the first round of the 2018 MLB Draft, Nico Hoerner immediately became a type of hitter that the Cubs hadnt had in a long time; someone who could hit for contact. The Stanford shortstop flew through the minors, and got a cup of coffee at the end of the 2019 season. Hoerner had a promising 2021 season, but with the departures of the established core, 2022 was Hoerners time to shine. He took the opportunity with both hands, getting 517 PAs, hitting .281/.327/.410 at the shortstop position, along with a 13 OAA, tied for 2nd-most for any shortstop, only behind current teammate Dansby Swanson. Additionally, he stole 20 bases on 22 attempts, making him one of the most effective base stealers in the game, something thats become more of a dying art as the years pass. With the Cubs signing Swanson, Hoerner will be moving to 2nd base, filling one of the largest holes the Cubs had last year. Nico Hoerner, as he is now, is a perfect member of a competitive core. Hes young, defensively capable, and he gets on base. In order for the Cubs to compete, they need Nico to continue being excellent, something hes primed to do for years to come.

#**#91 - Willson Contreras - St. Louis Cardinals [](/STL) - Catcher**

**Written by:** u/Bnavis

Willson Contreras is one of the best hitting catchers baseball has ever seen. Since debuting in 2016, he has had only one season with a below 100 OPS. He is a steady 20 HR hitter, and he has a cannon of an arm behind home plate. There are shouts of his framing being below average, but as any Cubs fan could tell you, all is forgiven through homers. Contreras has massive shoes to fill in 2023, signing a 5 year, $87.5 million contract with the Cardinals, replacing the legendary Yadi Molina. Just like Molina, Willson is an everyday catcher, catching over 100 games in almost every year hes been on the major league roster. He is joining a roster which had the top 2 NL MVP vote getters, and won the division with ease. Adding a consistent 4 WAR player at baseballs shallowest position can do nothing but help. There is no question that a Cardinals roster with Willson is the forerunner in the NL Central, and he is without a doubt one of the top 100 players in baseball.","baseball",44,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/104duau/rbaseball_top_100_players_for_the_2023_season/"

"2023-08-18",1692370302,"NL Wild Card Predictions?","The NL Wild Card race is looking like it's going to come down to the wire, with 3 teams, Chicago, Miami, and Cincinnati, tied for the final wild card spot and Arizona only a game back of them. Technically San Diego is only 5 games back of a spot, and their roster is certainly talented enough to go on a run in September (they've been long due for a hot streak for about 4 months now though, to be fair). Also, the Giants are only a game up on those teams, and Philly is 2.5 games up on them. Give me some of your predictions on who's going to be the final 3 teams standing, as well as the reasoning behind it.

I'll start: 

I think it's going to be Philly, Arizona, and Miami that get the final 3 spots. 

Philly is the most talented team of the bunch and has been playing great ball since June, and built themselves a small cushion that I think should get them over the hump. Lorenzen has been a great acquisition, and the fans have seemingly willed Trea Turner into being a good baseball player again. They've also been here before, so I think that experience will be enough to help them remain in a WC spot.

Arizona, despite their bad July, has looked the part of a playoff team, and they look like they finally came out of that slump. The 1-2 punch of Gallen and Kelly has been keeping up their end of the rotation, and Tommy Pham and Paul Sewald have been great deadline acquisitions. They've won 5 of 6 after their recent L9 and I just have a feeling that they're going to get hot.

Miami had a fantastic deadline themselves, with new acquisitions Bell and Burger providing a jolt to their offense and giving them a new dimension that they simply have not had in a while. Their pitching remains solid, and Sandy has been better over the last couple starts, which has helped stabilize the rest of their rotation as well.

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| The Rays had a wacky week, playing a close series against the Astros before bullying the White Sox for 35 innings. It seems the Rays do have some weaknesses, those being Astros SPs and Jalen Beeks/back-end bullpen depth. It's time to see if accusations of an easy start have merit, as the Rays enter a long stretch against .500+ teams. This stretch begins against the NL leading Pirates in the series of the year so far, in addition to giving Rays fans a much needed reunion with Ji-Man Choi.  |**23-6**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 4-1 on a rain shortened week. Take away the collapse on Thursday against the Marlins, and it was an incredibly successful week. We needed that after a really tough previous week. Acuña is doing Acuña things. If he can stay healthy and stay at this pace, MVP will be his. Big tough week this week. Let's get it. |**18-9**
**3**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+4**| When the Brotation is good, we good. It won't last, but our boys combined for a 0.98 ERA over the last 10 starts. Berrios and Kikuchi look absolutely reborn, which means Smaug or the Babadook should be descending on our hopes any day now. Even the bullpen was fucking nails over this recent stretch until a heartbreaking blow job (I said what I said) that kept us from sweeping the Mariners. We also took a series from the Yankees and steamrolled through a really bad, listless White Sox team during the rest of last week. Bichette is murdering balls like horny camp counselors in an 80s slasher, Chapman is playing at an MVP pace ahead of a big free agency that we won't be able to afford, and even our long-lost good boy Sasquatch Nate Pearson made an appearance. Vibes are as high as Kevin Gausman on an off day right now. |**18-10**
**4**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| Christian Yelich has hit .223 with a .340 slugging percentage and has struck out nearly 30 percent of the time.  I think it's time for me to consider this is what he is now, rather than the MVP candidate he was.  A 3-3 record this past week wasn't great considering the competition, but Milwaukee is still 18-10 on the season so I can't complain that bad. |**18-10**
**5**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+3**| The Texas Rangers end the month atop of the AL West so thats a fun thing to say. Weird week after getting swept by the Reds but then a bounce back 3 game winning streak to take 3 out of 4 from the Yankees. With Arizona and a start of a West Coast Trip coming up it will interesting to see if this team is legit or not. |**17-11**
**6**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+7**| MLB.com's Justice delos Santos had a great story this week about the leadership that veterans like Andrew McCutchen and Carlos Santana can bring to a young team like the Pirates. When Oneil Cruz went down with his ankle injury a few weeks ago and all seemed lost, McCutchen and Santana held a postgame meeting to remind everyone that the injury would not define this team. This week, Cutch and Santana held another postgame meeting after the Pirates blew a 5-run lead in a 8-7 loss to Los Angeles; instead of spiraling, the Bucs won the next two games against the Dodgers and then took 2 of 3 from Washington. There are a lot of metrics that can track how well the Pirates have played this year, but the kind of intangibles that guys like McCutchen and Santana bring were sorely missed in years past, and are a big reason why the Bucs have gotten off to such a hot start (also, congrats to Drew Maggi on his first MLB hit!) |**20-9**
**7**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+3**| If you had told me at the end of April, the Orioles would be one of less than a handful of teams with still less than 10 losses I would have called you a liar. Not that I didn't think they would be good, but to be 10 games over .500 at the end of the first month is a little surprising. They sent one of their off-season acquisitions back to AAA and the hitting has been streaky. This team though is having fun and it shows. May will be the test though. After this upcoming series with the Royals, they are at Atlanta, home for Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh and the Angels. Then back on the road to Toronto and the Yankees, then to come home for the Rangers and Cleveland. If they end this month above .500 that will be a statement. |**19-9**
**8**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-3**| All good things must come to an end, with Mauricio Dubon's hitting streak snapping at 20 games this week. He has certainly helped fill the 5'4"" sized hole that Altuve has left, and it's unfortunate that he can't pitch as well because our pitching depth continues to be tested. Urquidy came out of yesterday's game with a shoulder injury, and LMJ is (presumably) alive and still rehabbing his ever-injured forearm. Starting to think we may see Forrest Whitley sooner than later. |**15-13**
**9**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**0**| A sweep of the Cardinals helped turn around the recent vibe of the Dodgers, who lately have felt more like the 2018 team than any other recent iteration (which Dodger fans know is not the compliment it may sound like considering that team somehow won the pennant). After finishing the last six seasons either first or second in the league in ERA, the 2023 Dodgers aren't even in the top half of the league right now, and their reliever ERA is bottom five. On a higher note, here is a list of hitters with a lower wRC+ than Jason Heyward: Jose Ramirez, Mookie Betts, Rafael Devers, Austin Riley, Juan Soto, Francisco Lindor, Julio Rodriguez, et al. |**16-13**
**10**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**| We won a series against the Yankees! We won a SERIES against THE YANKEES!! And we won the season series too! [For the first time since 2001!!](https://twitter.com/dohyoungpark/status/1651054576898920449) No matter what happens from here on out, this season is a success. |**17-12**
**11**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-5**| Thanks to some weather issues and an off day, we've only seen the Mets 4 times since last week's power rankings. In that time, they dropped 2 out of 3 to the Nats at home, and lost a 5-inning rain shortened game to Atlanta. One highlight has been Brett Baty's emergence at the plate. Baty mostly struggled in limited playing time in 2022, but is slashing .333/.394/.467 in his first 10 games of this campaign. Scherzer and Verlander will both return to the Mets rotation against Detroit this week, pending any setbacks. In personal news, I've had a friend crashing on my couch for the past week, he's leaving tomorrow and I'm looking forward to finally having some quiet time to watch some baseball this week. |**15-12**
**12**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-8**| The Yankees dropped 2/3 to Minnesota and 3/4 to Texas this week, the climax being the 15-2 embarrassment on Sunday. With Stanton and Judge both hurt, and Bader still rehabbing, this team has been reduced to consistently batting Willie Calhoun in the five hole. Now, the Yanks can look forward to two of their next four series against the division-and-league-leading Rays. Unless some of these AAA cast-offs start heating up, it looks like itll be a rough start to May. |**15-14**
**13**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| Look, we all knew the Pads were playing a pair in Mexico city this year. If you didn't have Lucha inspired Padres Piñata Party on your '23 season bingo card, you're just not paying much attention. Shout out Ha-Seong Kim, he's already on the D-War leaderboards for his play at second this season, ranking (tied for) 5th. Last season for his efforts at mostly shortstop, he finished (tied for 11th) across the MLB, with 2.1 defensive wins above replacement.  |**15-14**
**14**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**0**| The Cubs went 2-4 this week, taking 2 of 3 against the Padres to start. They followed that up with an infuriating sweep to the Marlins, losing 3 one run games. The bullpen had a bad week, giving up the lead in 2 of the 3 games. On the positive side, Cody Bellinger continued his resurgent year and Nico Hoerner extend his on base streak to 23 games. The Cubs travel to Washington for 4 games, after which they will have a chance for revenge against the Marlins |**14-13**
**15**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had a decent week by record, taking two of three from both the Royals and the Rockies, but still have to be a bit disappointed to face these struggling teams and not come away with a sweep in either series. Corbin Carroll was injured on a play in the outfield, and while he is officially day-to-day, we are still crossing our fingers that it doesn't turn out to have been more serious. The starting pitching is still likely to be a problem going forward. |**16-13**
**16**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+4**| One month in seems as good of a time as any to stop, point out, and appreciate Hunter Renfroe. His start to his Angels career has been everything and more that the team could have realistically hoped for. He is walking more, striking out less, and is at career highs in AVG, OBP, and SLG. Even his fielding, suspect as the statistics may be, has been grading out positive. He is certainly proving to be one of the better offseason acquisitions and he figures to be an important piece if this team is to inch into a playoff position.  |**15-14**
**17**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+1**| Things may be finally turning around for the Phillies after a rough start to the year. They're over .500 after winning 2/3 from both the Mariners and the Astros. While the offense has slowed down a bit, the pitching has stepped up their game, allowing just 16 runs over 6 games. There isn't much to worry about with the offense, however as Bryce Harper is set to make his miraculously early return from Tommy John surgery after just 160 days. Ranger Suarez is a week or two from returning and shoring up the rotation, while top prospect Andrew Painter has begun a long rehab. It's not all good news, as surprising bright spot Cristian Pache suffered a knee injury and Trea Turner is in a deep slump, but the vibes are great in Philadelphia. This week, it's 3 against the Dodgers in LA before returning home for a 3 game series against the Red Sox. |**15-14**
**18**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+1**| With Ort in AAA, Sox fans are one Ryan Brasier DFA away from fully exorcising all bullpen demons. Wong and Duran have stepped up and helped solidify the lineup, and starting pitching is looking *slightly* more competent. We're beating the teams we're supposed to beat and losing to the ones that are actually good, which is about what you'd expect. Also Yankees last in the AL East hahahaha. You'd expect it from a small market low payroll team like Boston, but *New York*??? |**15-14**
**19**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-4**| So, I put the Rays, Orioles and Pirates in the top five. These are strange times. But my job is to talk about the Guardians, something I don't really like to do right now. We once again only won 1/3 games in two series against last place teams, including a team that's probably in the bottom five in baseball. I don't know what happened to the team that came within a game of the ALCS last year. |**13-15**
**20**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| The vibes are... not great. This team still looks like they have the talent to compete, and pitching has been quite good on the whole so far, but when the top of your lineup is all slumping at the same time that doesn't really matter much. Here's hoping the M's can avoid their perennial May woes this go around. Up next: 3 @ Moneyballs, 3 vs. BOOOOOOOO |**12-16**
**21**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| The marlins are 10-0 in one run games on the season, which is a bit indicative of how our offense continues to improve bit by bit. Give the hitting coach any money left over from mel stottlemeyer. In a continuing trend, we lost a series to the braves and then [sweepy](https://imgur.com/gflU3Uu?r) made an appearance after we swept the cubs. sandy will be fine yall, dont fret. were playing the braves at home and then the cubs in chitown, who the fuck made the schedule this year.... |**16-13**
**22**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-1**| The  Cards just finished April with their worst start this side of 2000. 10-19, last week a terrible 1-6 with a single win against the Giants in 4 before being swept by the Dodgers. The team is better than how they're playing, but should matters very little at 10 games back a month in. May settles whether this is a slow start or the season.  |**10-19**
**23**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| Last time I said it would be a successful week if the Giants won 3-4 games. Well, they won 3: taking a 4-game series against the Cardinals before dropping both Mexico City games in forgettable fashion. I cant even tell you what happened during several of these games because they insisted on occurring during Warriors games. With apologies to our Sacramento Giants fan readers, we had delicious Curry last night. The tough part of the schedule continues as the Giants head to Houston and then host the Brewers. Lets glance at the numbers: -18 Run Diff is 22nd in MLB (bad), 12th in RS / G (good), 25th in RA / G (very bad), 28th in Bullpen ERA (hot garbage), 50 pts in Game 7 (spicy). Yaz and Craw are banged up  look for the Giants again this week to try and play .500 baseball. Beat LA, fuck John Fisher. |**11-16**
**24**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+1**| I am so confused by this Reds team, I think they need help. There are games where I question whether or not this is an MLB caliber club and then they go on to sweep the Rangers and go on a 5 game win streak. I don't understand you Reds. I just want to know what's going on. If you tell me what's wrong we can find you the right help, but you gotta take the first steps to getting support, we can't do it for you. Anyway, I'm going to go take my weekly Chili soak bath, maybe in peace I can find out what the hell this team is about. |**12-16**
**25**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+2**| Despite what a very specific group of people on r/nationals will tell you, Mike Rizzo is still really good at trading. His 4 top players this year (Keibert Ruiz, Josiah Gray, MacKenzie Gore, and Mason Thompson) all came from post-World Series trades. The team is 10-17 coming off being the worst team in baseball which feels like a huge accomplishment with team payroll hovering $100M (anchored by Patrick Corbin and Stephen Strasburg). |**10-17**
**26**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| The hitting is somehow uglier than we thought it would be. With the team slashing .222/.290/.338, the lineup is both punchless and inefficient. In fact, Matt Vierling and Zach McKinstry are the only regulars hitting above .250 at the plate while Nick Maton and Kerry Carpenter (IL) lead the team in dongs at 4 apiece. Our eyes look longingly at Justyn Henry-Malloy, who's slashing .344/.474/.527 in AAA Toledo, but he's only one potential solution in a lineup with more holes in it that a slice of Swiss cheese. This week: 3 vs. NYM, 3 at STL. |**10-17**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**+1**| Rockies went 3-3 this week, which is amazingly their best week of the season.  Strangely they got there by winning two of three against the Guardians on the road in convincing fashion, and then coming home and getting thumped in back-to-back games by the D-Backs.  German Marquez is back on the IL, and every depth chart I can find hilariously lists them as having three active starters.  Things are going ""great"". |**9-20**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-4**| Despite the most unlikely comeback (of all time) ((okay, just the season, probably)) on Sunday, Sox fans are all [Berto from the West Side](https://www.reddit.com/r/whitesox/comments/13047jn/heres_an_alltime_espn_1000_call_about_the_2023/) this season. |**8-21**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Kris Bubic finally took a step forward and is gone for the season. Brady Singer looked like he was developing into a top of the rotation arm and suddenly forgot how to pitch this year. Jordan Lyles exists. I have the same question that Mario has for god - Why?????? |**7-22**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| For the past 1.5 years, it looked like the A's were rallying around having a ""pretty good"" team in time for the 2027 Howard Terminal opening. They basically don't have any leverage in the situation with the Oakland City Council, so they've been creating some by messaging they're more than willing to go to Las Vegas. A land purchase there and monumentally stupid pr burned bridges with the local media, and obviously the poor play isn't helping fan relations any. It's a crappy time, although there's tangible bright spots on the field for the first time since mid-2021 (Esteury Ruiz, Jordan Diaz, Mason Miller are building blocks and already some of my favorite players of the past decade) |**6-23**","baseball",100,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1351ewn/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_5_pirates_set/"

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**+1**| 6-0 this week. 16-1 in the last 17 games. 29 games above .500 on the season. Best record in the MLB. Most homers and best OPS (by far) in the MLB. 8 All Stars. A 9 game lead in the standings on the second place Marlins who they are 9-1 against on the season. The Braves deserve this top spot. |**57-27**
**2**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-1**|  |**57-30**
**3**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| The Rangers have won 50 games before the all star break. They have 6 All Stars, 4 of which are starters. This team added Aroldis Chapman to a very thin bullpen and will definitely be adding more at the deadline I think. Finishing the first half with the Red Sox and Nationals this week so hopefully the team can finish strong. |**50-35**
**4**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had an okay week, dropping two of three to Tampa Bay before taking two of three from the Angels. This week could have been a lot better if not for a blown opportunity in the second game of the Rays series in which they surrendered three runs to lose the game in the 9th after holding the Rays scoreless all game. This team is young, fiery, and talented, but often can't seem to get out of its own way. |**50-35**
**5**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Tough week losing two straight series. 12 hits in the last 3 games total are not going to win you a lot of games. The positives are we are sending 4 guys to the All-Star game and Westburg looks really comfortable so far in his first week. The negatives, besides the offense, are injuries are starting to rear their ugly head. We are 28 days from the trade deadline, it will be interesting to see what moves Mike Elias makes this year. |**49-34**
**6**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**| It can be very hard to watch the Dodgers sometimes. I know we're spoiled or whatever but there is no reason that this team should be going 3-3 over the week when going up against the Royals and Rockies. Urias came back from injury and looked pretty bad, hopefully just because he's adjusting again, but we still long for the days with a strong healthy rotation (May and Buehler come back). The bullpen has seen some improvement recently which is great and hopefully the team can turn back to good next week against the Pirates and Angels. |**47-37**
**7**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+1**| Things are potentially not as bad as they have seemed, but the fanbase is still pretty riled up about Dusty, Montero, Maldonado, Julks, Chaz, Meyers, Abreu, Javier, injuries, who Brantley is, etc. You name it and Astros fans are upset about it. Thankfully, taking 3/4 from the Rangers up in Arlington was a nice way to finish out the week/start a new one. |**47-38**
**8**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-2**| We wanted 3 wins this week, and we got 2. But the Giants played 2 talented teams  and it's okay. Everything is okay. Wait, I just saw the results of Monday's game. I am less than okay now. |**46-39**
**9**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+1**| What's there to say about a perfect game that hasn't already been said? It was an incredible ride from start-to-finish assuming you were one of the brave handful of Yankees fans willing to stay up for a late game at the Coliseum. In other news, Carlos Rodon is scheduled to pitch July 7th, and Judge says he intends to return ""soon"", which is certainly better news than what we've been getting|**47-38**
**10**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**|Dimelo mi genteeeee, reporting live from the mountains of colombia. Sweepy continues his reign of terror this season, with his 7th appearance of the season. A sweep of the bosox hasnt happened in over 20+ years and this is also the first time weve beat them in fenway in 10+ years. Pitching has been pretty consistent and the offense has continued to be surprisingly clutch in late innings (despite the record setting pace of double plays...). Now that we got the good news out of the way, we also ran into the buzz saw that is the braves offense this past week. That hitting coach of theirs has the offense annoyingly consistent and has earned every penny of his salary. Marlins pitching doesnt seem to have a single answer for them. The only bits of silver lining we got on that note is that were still 3rd in the national league despite sandy being hella mid and jazz missing extended time. Stottlemeyer is gonna have to figure out how to keep braves hitters on their heels. Thankfully we got time since we dont face them again til mid september. Got the cards and phils comin to town this week before the ASB.  |**49-37**
**11**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**| The only problem with not being able to beat teams in the AL East is being a team in the AL East. Getting swept by Boston AGAIN soured what had been a great stretch of winning series, including vs SF to start the week. But the Red Sox raged in on Canada Day weekend and sullied the nation in a way not seen since William Hull stormed Upper Canada in 1812. (Google it.) The offense has gone cold at the wrong times with our season-long RISP issues, but we're also starting to see the effects of a bullpen that has been tasked to do more with the Manoah-less Jays running a 4-man rotation all month. Thankfully the injury bug has mostly ignored the Jays all year, and after what appears to be an easy week with CHW and DET, there'll be a lot of decisions to make at the ASG for a team that needs to return to a regular rotation.  |**45-40**
**12**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| For as brilliant as Shohei Ohtani has been on the mound, Reid Detmers has been matching him tit-for-tat. Detmers is nearly matching him with an impressive 11.26 K/9 and he's actually walking fewer batters and allowing fewer home runs. Unfortunately, the rotation outside of this duo has been thoroughly underwhelming. Chief among the disappointments has been Patrick Sandoval. His strike-out rates have had a precipitous decline and his command has regressed. If this team is going to have any shot at a postseason run in the second half, it's going to have to start with him and Tyler Anderson figuring themselves out.  |**45-42**
**13**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| Shopping for a soon to be divorced house is odd. I still enjoy the distraction the Reds give, especially with all the winning theyre doing, though our starting pitching is still ass monkeys outside of Andrew Abbott. But I was at Kroger doing some shopping for the first time in what seemed like forever, and I was just lost. I dont know what to make, she always did that, mostly because she had all these recipes she got from her mom. I didnt have anything. Growing up we ate what felt like the same 6 things over and over and over, now that Im alone I dont know what to buy. Why are there so many different kinds of food? I just want some cereal man, why are there 40 different cereals? I just want some Captain Crunch. The aisle is neverending. Theres way too many cereals and different kinds of Captain Crunch. And the Captain, hes staring at me, always smiling with his mouth open, telling me yeah my cereal stays crunchy even when in its milk, its honestly not even that impressive of an accomplishment, why name an entire cereal after it? Why name a person after it? Whats he even the captain of? Hes dressed like an 18th century naval captain but they didnt have captain crunch back then now did they? Why is there a Captain Crunch cereal with only Berries? Its even called Oops all Berries, Im sorry what? Seriously youre not even the least bit sorry Captain, that Oops is a fucking farce. There is no way the machine that makes the Captain Crunch just accidentally put only berries into a bag okay? Its just not possible, in fact if it was an accident, wheres the FDA report on it Captain? Huh? Thats an accident in the place you manufacture and package food and there is no report of an accident where only berries went into the bag. Its not there, fucking search for yourself. You know what I think Captain? I think you put only Berries in the bag on purpose, I think you care very little about this problem, that Oops is the most insincere thing I've heard since I told my wife we can still salvage our marriage. I was lying then because I wanted to believe it, and youre lying to me about these fucking Berries. How long are we going to let Captain Crunch lie to us? Who even wants a cereal of only Berries? Who? Who out there said yeah let's make a cereal of only berries. THE BERRIES WERE THERE TO COMPLIMENT THE CAPTAIN CRUNCH, IF YOURE GONNA MAKE AN ONLY BERRIES CEREAL WHY IS IT STILL CALLED CAPTAIN CRUNCH? I am angered, I am beside myself, I am sitting on the floor of a Kroger crying and people are asking me if im alright, I am just done with this goddamn Captain Crunch. Im leaving without buying anything, Im having Taco Bell for the 4th time this week. |**46-39**
**14**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+1**| The Phillies swept the Braves :D! The Phillies lost 2/3 to the Nationals, losing 2 very winnable games and blowing them out in the game they won. :(. The pitching staff only allowed 18 runs in 6 games, but somehow this 4-2 week felt like a failure, probably considering it was against teams they should beat. Taijuan Walker hs continued to be absolutely electric, with 3 runs allowed in 32 innings in his last 5 starts. Wheeler and Nola continue to have their struggles while still being servicable, while Ranger Suarez had a great first start of the week and looked good minus one inning in his second. The real story of the season thus far has been Nick Castellanos and his comeback season for the ages, rightfully earning him a spot in the All-Star Game. His OPS is up 180 points for the second best rate of his career. Bryce Harper, in one of the most concerning slumps of his career, still has a 120 OPS+. The Phillies go into the All-Star break with a Florida road trip, with 3 against the Rays and 3 against the Fish. |**44-39**
**15**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**| The Brewers continue to be a bit of an enigma on what they could do to address the rosters performance.  Having players return from the IL might be the ""big""  trade deadline move (please no setbacks Brandon Woodruff).    I'm not expecting wonders from the new signee Jahmai Jones, but the .293/.428/.543 AAA slash line is really appealing to a team with a .226/.305/.370 combo.  Hell, he's not even 26, maybe we found something that can hit? |**46-39**
**16**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-2**| The important story this week isn't that we got swept in Atlanta, but how the team responded to it. Rocco breaking character to criticize the team's *effort* is unheard of, and the team's follow-up player's only meeting seems to have had some effect with a hard-fought series in Baltimore that we took 2-1. Hopefully, this week will be seen as the season's turning point. |**43-43**
**17**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-1**| Did someone say it's Canada Day? I couldn't hear you over the overwhelming sound of freedom ringing throughout Rogers Centre. Even with this sweep, the Sox remain on the periphery of the wildcard race alongside Toronto and LA (AL). Our starting pitching situation is growing more dire with Garrett Whitlock's elbow issue. If he hits the IL, we're looking at a rotation of Paxton, Bello, Kutter, Pivetta?, and TBD. At least 6 of our next 12 games are against Oakland. |**43-42**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+2**| Lose a series to the Nats, win a series against the Rays - now that's what I call Mariners Baseball. The water treading continues as we enter the second half, and it feels very reminiscent of 10ish years ago. Luis Castillo is the sole M's rep for the hometown all-star game, a far cry from the eight in 2001, but such is what happens when your team is playing like this. Up next: 3 @ Gnats, 4 @ Asterisks |**41-42**
**19**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**+2**| The Guardians' series against the Royals and Cubs were a bit too close for comfort. This week we play the Braves. What could possibly go wrong? |**41-43**
**20**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**| The Cubs slumped back to earth with a disappointing 1-5 week, including a sweep at the hands of the Phillies. While there was a glimmer of hope that they would make some noise in the division with their previous hot stretch, those hopes are fading as the Cubs are now 6 Games out in the NL Central and despite Tom Ricketts' words, look likely to be sellers again. Heading into the All Star Break, they will need to do well against the Brewers and Yankees to stay in sight in the division. |**38-45**
**21**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-2**| Looking at the club, you have the league leader in Ops, and three starters that are doing very well, and have been trending that way at least for a month. Hader is tied for 3rd in the NL for saves, and the team has one of the best defensive infields in baseball. 4th place, losing record. Im not sure if the burden of expectations has crippled this team, but Im done, expecting anything at this point. When the Padres find so many unique ways to lose, you cant have any expectations for them. Sometimes it just doesnt work out. |**39-46**
**22**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+1**| On one hand, this could have been a better week if the Pirates' pitching didn't bellyflop over the weekend (please don't ever make me watch Ryan Borucki again). On the other hand, the Bucs still went 4-2 this week against the Padres and Brewers with the offense showing some signs of life. Amazing what adding a top prospect to the lineup can do.  |**39-45**
**23**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| My mom is getting married next weekend. She met her fiance at Citi Field - he was the usher in a section where she had a ticket plan a few years back. This is the only positive thing the Mets have ever brought to either of our lives. If I hear another one of my Yankees fan friends complaining about how bad their team is, I'm going to go ballistic. |**38-46**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**| Hicks has been pitching well; some nicety in taking series off the Astros and Yankees. Fire Mozeliak. |**35-49**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| One step back but a couple steps forward? Matthew Boyd unfortunately needs Tommy John surgery not even two years after flexor tendon surgery, but this past week saw the return of Matt Manning and this upcoming week will likely see the returns of Tarik Skubal and Eduardo Rodriguez as well to the rotation. Those three plus (""All-Star"") Michael Lorenzen should offer the most stability the rotation has seen all year... for a little bit before Lorenzen is ineevitably traded away as an expiring contract to a contender (for less than delusional fans think he's worth, of course, because nobody pays up for a rental anymore). This week: 3 vs. OAK, 3 vs. TOR. |**37-46**
**26**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| It's been 2 weeks since I asked the White Sox to either shorten the 5.5 game lead in the division or fall out of the race entirely. I am proud to announce that they are currently...*checks notes*...5.5 games back of the division. This team is truly awful to watch as they lost a series to the As (with an excellent dig at us via A's Twitter). The Sox did their best to get swept, but it was not meant to be. The 5.5 lead remains immutable and my day is ruined and my disappiontment is immeasurable. |**37-49**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Jeimer Candelario is an All-Star in my heart, no matter what it says in the program. We took a gamble on him and he rewarded us with the 2nd best 3B WAR this year and will bring a handsome return at the trade deadline from someone. Congrats to Josiah! |**34-50**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The Rockies went 2-4 this week, getting destroyed by the Dodgers and losing to the Tigers as well.  We're getting to that point in the season that I'm finding it hard to watch games because they're just too depressing |**33-53**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| The Royals blow more than Mia Khalifa but somehow took the series from the Dodgers. 2-0 in July feels like some sort of victory. The reality is that the Royals are just going to decrease their chances of landing the top overall pick in the 2024 MLB Draft. Not that it matters because they'll fuck up that pick anyway... |**25-60**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| Since they started June in PIT, the A's are 11-13. That's about where I expected them to be this year- bad, but alarmingly mid when playing teams in the AL/NL centrals (seriously, those divisions aren't real baseball are you kidding me). Instead, the A's are staring down one of the worst seasons in history, exponentially worse than those pitiful mid-america teams. There's a lot of dudes on this roster, none of them are good, but a few of them aren't bad either.  |**23-63**","baseball",48,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/14qis6b/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_14_on_this/"
"2023-05-01",1682902934,"Introducing the All-Preller Trade Team","We all know that AJ Preller is a sort of semiannual whirling dervish (Darvish?), spinning up trade after trade every January and July as if standing pat might literally kill him. But almost every time you bring a guy in, you've gotta send (at least) a guy out, and the Padres have waved goodbye to a veritable murderer's row of sluggers over the years. I thought I'd assemble an MLB roster of guys that the Padres could have under team control right now, had they only chosen to follow the authority of a man rather than an animate pile of good ole Colombian white lightning.

**Some names that didn't make the list for eligibility reasons:** 

First, I thought these guys were worth mentioning; couldn't include them because they've hit free agency since Preller let 'em loose, and thus are no longer albatrosses hanging around his neck.

SS Trea Turner: Traded away for Wil Myers, and accumulated 31.7 fWAR on his rookie contract.

C Yasmani Grandal: Traded away for Matt Kemp, and accumulated 19.7 fWAR on his rookie contract.

SP Zach Eflin: Traded away for Matt Kemp, worth 8.7 fWAR.

2B Jedd Gyorko: Traded away for Jon Jay, worth 8.5 fWAR.

RF Steven Souza Jr.: Traded away for Wil Myers, worth 6.8 fWAR.

RP Craig Kimbrel: Traded away for (basically) Margot, worth 5.7 fWAR.

**Now, on to our All-Preller Team:**

**Catcher: Francisco Mejia, Tampa Bay Rays**

Part of the Snell return, Mejia isn't very good, so we don't really start off with a bang. He's produced below-average results for the Rays in a few seasons of work. Soon, he'll be replaced on the All-Preller team by Endy Rodriguez, the Pirates' 55-FV #2 prospect, part of the return for Joe Musgrove. Other options: Victor Caratini, Austin Hedges, Luis Torrens.

**First Baseman: Josh Naylor, Cleveland Guardians**

Don't let his .612 OPS fool you: Naylor's been a great bat so far this year, with an xwOBA of .363 and a slick glove at the not-hot corner. He also plays a bit of RF, as a treat. He was traded away for Andrew Cashner. Other options: Ty France, Luke Voit.

**Second Baseman: Tucupita Marcano, Pittsburgh Pirates**

Marcano's been mashing this year after a lackluster 2022 campaign, and he's definitely played his part in the Pirates' rise to the top of the National League, which is sustainable and will last until 2050 at least. [MLB.com](https://MLB.com) thinks he's a 50 FV, Fangraphs a 35+. Opinions are certainly divided. Padres return: Adam Frazier.

**Shorstop: CJ Abrams, Washington Nationals**

His 60 FV prospect ranking is pulling a lot of weight here; he hasn't done much of anything in the majors so far, but he's only 22. Juan Soto is pretty good, in other news. Other options: Slapdick Prospect Xavier Edwards. 

**Third Baseman: Luis Urias, Milwaukee Brewers**

Urias is a steady role player at 3B, putting in slightly above average work the last couple of years. He's currently out with a hamstring strain. 

**Left Fielder: Brent Rooker, Oakland Athletics**

He's literally the best hitter in baseball this year not named Matt Chapman. Is it gonna last? Who knows? Who cares? Padres traded him for Cameron Gallagher, and I doubt even Padres fans know who that is. 

**Center Fielder: Jack Suwinski, Pittsburgh Pirates**

There's no overstating how good Suwinski has been so far. Elite defense, elite offense, and elite speed are all there in a heck of a start to his 2023. Do I think he's the next Trout? No, but this is a foundation for greatness regardless. Traded away for Adam Frazier.

**Right Fielder: Taylor Trammell, Seattle Mariners**

Trammell hasn't played much in Seattle so far, and returns on the field have been about average. He has a decent pedigree as a prospect, though, and a grand slam in his first PA of the year, so that's something. 

Honorable mentions in the outfield: James Wood (FV 55), Robert Hassell (FV 55), Esteury Ruiz (FV 45).

**Rotation:**

**Max Fried, Atlanta Braves**

His xERA each of the past four years: 2.88, 3.47, 2.85, 1.81. He's one of the undisputed best pitchers in baseball. His most notable accomplishment, though? Being ""more of a Lucchesi-level guy than a Paddack-level guy"", per one Padres fan in my comments. Traded away for Justin Upton. 

**Luis Castillo, Seattle Mariners**

He's signed an extension, but this would've been his last arbitration year. He's reliably put in low-3's xERAs for the Mariners since ending up there, but the Padres actually ""traded him away"" by revoking his participation in a trade with Miami. 

**MacKenzie Gore, Washington Nationals**

He's probably the best player on the Nationals already, sporting a 3.35 xERA and a 31% K-rate with plenty of room to grow and mature. He was part of the Soto package.

**Joey Lucchesi, New York Mets**

He's a regression candidate, sure, but the early returns sure are nice in New York. The Dads traded him away to get Musgrove.

**Luis Patino, Tampa Bay Rays**

This rotation just ain't that deep right now. He's got the prospect pedigree (FV 60), but the results have ranged from below average to pretty terrible in Tampa so far.

Honorable mentions: Eric Lauer, Cal Quantrill, Logan Allen (FV 50), Jarlin Susana (FV 50), Joey Cantillo (FV 45), Robert Gasser (FV 45)

**Bullpen:**

**David Bednar, Pittsburgh Pirates**

After excellent 2021 and 2022 campaigns, Bednar has emerged this year as a candidate for the best reliever in baseball. The Pirates got him in the Frazier trade, which was pretty much just highway robbery.

**Andres Munoz, Seattle Mariners**

He was acquired in the Nola deal, one of the worst trades in the history of baseball. He's only pitched a few innings this year but was night unhittable the year before; the Padres would trade quite a lot to acquire his replacement in Hader, and it's arguable if it was even an upgrade.

**Emmanuel Clase, Cleveland Guardians**

His 2023 campaign has been merely very good, a step back from his usual excellence. The Padres traded him away for, uh, ""Brett Nicholas"". 

**Phil Maton, Houston Astros**

Maton is an under-the-radar relief ace, pitching to a 1.81 xERA on a 36% strikeout rate. He was traded away for cash considerations.

**Matt Brash, Seattle Mariners**

Brash strikes out 43% of batters he faces and doesn't let them do much with the pitches they do hit; his 5.25 ERA is a complete farce and the M's should enjoy watching that figure regress to his 2.73 xERA. He was acquired when the Padres traded for Taylor Williams.

**Mason Thompson, Washington Nationals**

Traded away for Daniel Hudson, Thompson has blossomed in Washington, putting in a 2.65 xERA while only walking 1.4% of batters faced. 

**Emilio Pagan, Minnesota Twins**

The Padres shipped him out for Taylor Rogers and Brent Rooker and then flipped both of them. The K's haven't come yet in 2023, but his results are excellent anyway.

**In Conclusion:**

Is it the best team in baseball? No. But it's a solid lineup, a good rotation with an absolutely killer top 3, and easily the best bullpen in baseball. Was it worth it to acquire the murderer's row the Padres have right now? Time will tell, but the amount of former-Padre talent around the league is frankly absurd. Remember, these are just the guys that are still on the contracts the Padres traded away; include the ineligible names too and you might have a World Series squad on your hands.","baseball",153,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1348g0n/introducing_the_allpreller_trade_team/"

**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| We clinched the division and a bye in the first round this week...so that's good. Being swept by the Marlins wasn't great, but 2 of the 3 games we were without Ronald. The really proves how valuable he is at the top of our order. We look to get as healthy as possible in these last few weeks. |**96-53**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**| The Dodgers officially clinched their 10th division title in the last 11 years which I would say is at least moderately impressive. Despite all the doubters and people who root for the perennial underdog Dodgers they have come through once again through pure grit and salary. Even our hungover B team beat the Mariners (sorry Mariners bros and sis's). I cannot wait for the playoffs.  |**91-57**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Best case scenario from this weekend would have been a sweep and the O's be 6 games up, worst case scenario would have been to be swept and the O's be 2 games back. What happened was a split in a very very good series. The O's have a 2-game lead in the East and have clinched a playoff spot for the first time in 7 years. Now it is off to Houston for 3 and Cleveland for 4. Two places where teams still have something to play for. Time to go get it. |**93-56**
**4**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| One out away from amazing success for the week, the Rays will have to settle for clinching a 5th straight playoff berth. And for a new stadium. Wait what? A deal was struck?? WE'RE NOT LEARNING FRENCH?!?! Breath held until it actually opens, but it's the most positive thing that's been announced after years of wacky rumors. Maybe they can still win the division too? |**92-59**
**5**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| Overall, I'd call this week a struggle bus week. Our playoff hopes are really coming down to the wire and it's unclear whether we can manage to have both our pitching and hitting on the same page at the same time. At least the Orioles will be hungover today, so we might win this one. |**84-66**
**6**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**| When Milwaukee traded for Mark Canha at the deadline I thought he was just going to be a rental.  Now? I think that there's going to be some very serious discussion about if Milwaukee picks up his 11MM option for next season.  With Milwaukee he's hitting .319 and getting on base at a rather silly .404 rate.   |**84-65**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| What started as the worst week of the season quickly turned into proof that while the Baseball Gods may be cruel, they sometimes bathe you in the glory of their love. A four-game sweep at the hands of the Walker Texas Rangers (outscored 35-9) was followed by sweeping the Red Sox and the Rangers, Mariners, and Astros all forgetting how to win, propelling us right back into the WC2 with a 78.2% chance to make the playoffs, per FanGraphs. The offensive woes are still concerning (apart from Vladdy, who's been hotter than ever the last two weeks), as we needed all sorts of fuckery to pull off that Boston sweep, but thankfully our pitching staff is absolute nails. It's tough to realize how far below our expectations we are, watching TB and Baltimore battle for the division as they clinch playoff spots, but all we care about now is making a postseason run. Two home-and-away series remain against the Rays and the Yankees, with a constant eye on the AL West teams fighting each other. |**83-67**
**8**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+3**| I don't even know anymore. |**82-67**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies continue to lose winnable games and hover around .500 overall. Thankfully, the rest of the Wild Card race isn't doing anything to cause stress. Braves, Mets, Pirates, Mets to end off the year isn't too bad. |**81-68**
**10**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| The September vibes are, to put it mildly, not great. Far too many games where defeat has been clutched from the jaws of victory, and the M's find themselves on the outside looking in. That said, it's AL West opponents from here on out, and like I said last week, those final 10 games are going to be the decider. I still think this team will end up sneaking in, but it's going to be close and all depends on if the offense can show up over the next two weeks or if they burnt it all out in August.  Up next: 3 @ SELL THE TEAM, 3 @ Texas gauntlet part one |**81-68**
**11**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**| The magic number is at 6, the team is playing well, and the last two weeks are set up exactly how you'd hope to get players rest while warming up for the postseason. Let's go! |**79-71**
**12**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks are the most hated team (outside of the Bears) in Chicago at the moment, having taken 6 of 7 against the Cubs in the last two weeks. The bullpen has been nails and the offense is playing like their lives depend on itcan the starting pitching get the memo, too? The next two weeks will be exciting, as Snakes fans hope to see their team in the postseason for the first time since 2017 |**79-72**
**13**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-3**| The Cubs had a disastrous road trip that they simply could not afford, going 1-5 against the Rockies and D-Backs. As a result, what was once a decent lead in the NL Wild Card race has completely eroded; the Cubs are out of a Wild Card spot as it currently stands. The biggest culprit has been an inability to get clutch hits, as over the past week they have a WRC+ of 83 in non low leverage situations. Additionally, the once stout bullpen has been hampered by injuries to Adbert Alzolay and Michael Fulmer. The Cubs need a dramatic turnaround against the Pirates and Rockies to avoid a repeat of the painful 2019 collapse. |**78-72**
**14**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**0**| Sweepy has returned! God damn was it good to see the fish sweep the barves.This offense looks scary right now, jazz is getting hot and burger/bell keeps rollin. The return of Soler has apparently been what this offense needed, too. Shoutout to Arraez for his multiple lead off dingers. Idk how the bullpen is gonna keep strong but Tanner Scott still has massive balls. One last shoutout to Jacob Stallings, who closed out yesterdays game with a scoreless 9th inning. We got the mets and brew crew visiting miami this week. |**78-72**
**15**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| I DONT HANDLE ANXIETY VERY WELL. The Reds are fighting for a playoff spot and I cant take the anxious mood. I dont handle it well, Im trying to find purpose, yesterday I drove my motorcycle into the pond outside my house. I tried to buy a Maya Fuji painting for $6,000 dollars. I didnt even like the painting. Who the fuck is Maya Fuji? I have to go to court tomorrow for the divorce proceedings, I got into a bidding war on Ebay over a lot of 700 Blu Ray movies just for the excitement. I WON. What the hell am I going to do with 700 Blu Ray movies? I checked the lot, theres 7 copies of Mr. Poppers Penguins. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH 7 COPIES OF MR. POPPERS PENGUINS? Imagine youre me, you now have half a dozen copies of Mr. Poppers Penguins on Blu Ray. Congratulations champ, what now? This is me. I want purpose, Ive been searching for it, I dont think its in the bottom of a box with 700 blu ray movies in it. Ive always liked history, maybe I could be a history teacher. I would have to go to college for that, but hey whats $60,000 of debt to stand in the way of dreams? I can take it. My credit score might not take it but I physically can. You know what, ive convinced myself, Im gonna search for some colleges that offer teaching programs. Im gonna do it. Right after I check the price for a Blu Ray player. |**78-73**
**16**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| I don't know. We are in the ""find out"" phase of the baseball season. It's too late to do anything other than watch it happen.Assuming magic doesn't happen, this is looking like an absolute wasted year. |**76-74**
**17**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+1**|  |**76-74**
**18**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| Soto's had his first San Diego slam, and first of his career, which was a surprise to me. Also...did the Padres just win 4 in a row? I didn't think that was alowed?  |**72-78**
**19**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-4**| Well, I guess that's it for the Chaim era in Boston. He was asked to do multiple things that directly conflicted with each other, did his best to please everyone, fell a little short on all fronts, and got fired right before things got good again. Ownership claimed to want to build an organization that could compete consistently, and then pulled out early just like they did with Cherington. They better hope the next guy gets a ring with this core. Regardless of how you felt about Chaim, we can all agree on this: fuck John Henry and fuck Fenway Sports Group. |**74-76**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians have 12 games left and need to go 9-3 to break 500. I don't see that happening. Oh well, you can't have a good year every year. We did have a good series against the Rangers this weekend, which was nice after that awful trip to California. |**72-78**
**21**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+1**| At least the Knicks come back soon. |**69-80**
**22**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+2**| Playing the Angels is a lot easier when their whole roster is injured eh? Miggy's go ahead knock in the 10th on Saturday was a fun experience as we geet to the halfway mark of the future HoFer's final month in the Bigs. This week: 3 at LAD, 4 at OAK to wrap up the final road trip of the season. |**70-79**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**0**| A good week that could have been better if Ji-hwan Bae knew how to throw to first (or hit, or play the field, or be a good person). The Bucs bounced back from dropping the opener against the Nats to steal 3 of 4 from Washington, then dropped 2 of 3 to the Yankees because of a blown double play in the 9th of Friday's game. This week, the Pirates have a chance to do serious damage to the playoff odds of two hated rivals. I hope they can pull it off. |**70-80**
**24**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-3**| I don't even really remember what it is like to enjoy baseball anymore. There have been plenty of flashes here or there the past decade, mostly just because of Mike Trout or Shohei, but that childlike love I used to have for the sport is just dead and I really don't think it is ever coming back.  |**68-82**
**25**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**|**No Blurb Submitted**  |**66-83**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Same as last week. Lerners, please sell. |**66-84**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| This weekend, I went to Milwaukee with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. We visited the Sprecher brewery for a tour, checked out Lakefront Brewery for the beautiful views and drinks, explored the Mitchell Park domes and came home with some beautiful orchids. We had a couple great dinners and a very memorable brunch at Brunch it Up. The only time baseball came up was when a couple next to us at brunch talked about how they were in town for the Brewers game, which just sounded like a nice thing to do. |**57-93**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| If the Rockies can go 7-6 until the end of the season, they can avoid 100 losses.  Unfortunately all but three of those games are against teams either heading to the playoffs or in close playoff races, so they'll be tough.  Those three games against a non-contending team are against the Padres, so even that might be difficult. |**56-93**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Keepin it  =¯ year in year out, that's the grind life baby.  We put a lot of effort into sucking ass. |**48-102**

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| It hasn't been the dominant Braves we have been accumstimed to seeing, but we have still gained ground on the second spot in our division over the last two weeks even if we did go 4-5 in our last 9 games. Taking the series from Milwakee hopefully gets us back on track. Fried is set to return in about a week. It will be interesting to see what we do for the trade deadline. My guess? Bullpen arms and some sort of surprise bat. |**64-34**
**2**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+1**| First series win in Tampa Bay in forever has the Orioles up 2 games in the AL East.  Gunnar Henderson in the leadoff spot is hitting .300 and Ryan O'Hearn has been a huge surprise in the lineup.  7 days before the trade deadline and to be honest I don't see Elias mortgaging the farm for this year.  Lots of prospects they could deal but I only see them making a couple more ""minor"" moves.  Mostly pitching and mostly relievers.  I know they need a starter and an ""impact"" bat, but they are still ahead of schedule this year.  Should be an interesting week. |**61-38**
**3**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-1**| The Rays have come back from the all-star break well-rested and still asleep, because woof its been a rough week. Basically, the offense isn't putting up mongo numbers and the bullpen leaking runs is now a problem because of that. Many of the recent losses have been frustrating- imagine battling back 5 runs, then the next inning it's immediately blown. While it's not likely to stay bad, it would be nice for Mr. Neander to give us some dopamine. |**61-42**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| Coming back from the All Star break and sweeping the Guardians and Rays had the team rolling but then Freddie Freeman showed up and thank God that's over. Big big series agains the Astros starting on Monday in Houston. The team is starting to pick up some mid season injuries with Seager heading to the IL, Garcia missing a day, and the team skipping Eovaldi's next start. This team could use a few more arms for the playoff push but not sure how much of the farm they are willing to part with to do that.  |**59-41**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| Dodgers faced one of their toughest road stretches of the year going against the Orioles, Rangers, and lolMets. They won all three series although continuing to be allergic to sweeping. In just a 17 inning stretch against the Rangers, they put up a whopping 31 runs. The pitching staff seems to be the largest issue with injuries continuing to pile up, although the offense has been carrying its weight then some. Freddie also debuted a new dance which has made the vibes in the clubhouse immaculate. |**57-41**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+1**| The Astros mostly took care of business last week, which was expected against the A's and Rockies. This week is arguably the most important week of the season thus far, as they're taking on the Rangers and Rays. The Astros are only 3 GB from the Rangers, so gaining SOME kind of ground - whether it's a sweep or at least one win - is imperative. O Yordan, wherefore art thou? |**56-44**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+1**| One of those infuriating, but ultimately not terrible, weeks. Lost 2, won 1 vs both San Diego and Seattle. Each series was winnable, with uncharacteristic bullpen failures in close/leading situations, a few bad management decisions, and a few guys nursing nagging injuries (Gausman, Romano). Winning a great game today at the Mariners felt like an exorcism, or one of those perfect no-wipe-required morning constitutionals, especially because it represented another okay-not-great-but-we'll-take-okay outings from Manoah. The big guy had some control issues still, but is showing a lot better command of his slider. Him getting stabilized along with Ryu coming back (and Chad Green in the pen) will make the trade deadline less pressing, considering like 12 other contenders are also looking to add a starter or two. Vladdy is mashing again, Kirk has actually looked like he has life at the plate, but we need a big meaty right handed bat, as we can hope but not assume guys like Varsho or Chapman regain their pop. On to LAD and LAL this week& |**55-45**
**8**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-2**| The Diamondbacks had a very bad week, dropping a chance to sweep the Braves in classic fashion (via the bullpen) before getting swept by the Reds in Cincy. The starting rotation is being held together by chewing gum and the bullpen might actually be better if it were bulls trying to pitch. Injuries are catching up to position players, as well.  |**54-46**
**9**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+7**| Sal Frelick certainly made a splash as soon as got the call up, but Milwaukee still needs a bat to help make an impact.  First base for the Brewers is just an absolutely abysmal thing to look at right now, I saw some talks of Milwaukee building a package for A's 1B Tyler Soderstrom, but I'm not sure how likely that is.   |**55-45**
**10**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| Where were you when the Giants offense ded? SF went from one of the hottest teams in baseball to one of the coldest via a 5-game losing streak, dropping them to&tied for 2nd in the NLW.  Most concerning, they lost out to the not-great Nationals and only 1 game of the last four has been close. Havent checked the numbers in a while, so lets do that: +21 Run Diff for 13th in MLB (fine-to-good), 13th in RS/G (fine), 13th in RA/G (wait, thats quite a coincidence), and 9th in Bullpen ERA (good, but not 13th). This all points to a team that should probably stop losing, especially to bad teams. Speaking of which, next up is @ DET for 1? Game, vs OAK for 2, and they finish the week vs the (good) Red Sox. |**54-46**
**11**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+1**| Ive spent weeks now using this as a place to vent, but this week, lets talk some goddamn baseball. Im not a sports writer, I dont know much about stats outside the surface level, but I am going to do this. Let me do some warmup stretches first&.alright, deep breaths, deep breaths, I am going to look at numbers and I am going to like it. Coming back from the all star break, things were pretty shaky. Milwaukee apparently just owns our souls this season, so if we want to win the division and get into the playoffs were going to have to do it by winning non divisional games. As I write this were on a 5 game win streak after sweeping the Diamondbacks, now we play Milwaukee again, which is not great because they just kill momentum. Many of our rookies have cooled off, understandably so, but we just keep reloading. Encarnacion-Strand has been called up, and hes one of the prospects Ive been most excited about, even though he needs to work on his plate discipline. This team feels like the future in many ways, a roster with seemingly half of it being taken up by rookies, with even more prospects on the verge of being called up as well. Noelvi Marte is a top 20 prospect whos in AAA, Connor Phillips is looking impressive in AAA as well, we have players like Chase Petty who is only in A ball but is looking like a potential ace, we just have prospects all over the place. Now the big question right now is trade deadline. Are the Reds gonna be buyers? I think this question can be simplified by another question: Should the Reds be buyers in the first place? In my professional opinion as a power rankings writer, no. I dont think we should do much buying at the deadline, with this roster, we can expect to do a lot of contending over the next 4-5 years, nobody really expected us to do this well this year, and while we do indeed have prospects that are sorta positionless on the team leaving them expendable for trades, I think waiting for next year or the year after is gonna be the time to go all in. If we make the playoffs this year, thatll be a good surprise but itll be overachieving. This team is gonna be really good for a few years, but I dont think buying at the deadline should concern us. Anyway, like I said Im not good at baseball analysis, so tune in next week where Ill instead analyze Mickey Unrapped, a 1994 hip hop album released by Disney featuring classic Disney characters rapping, featuring songs such as *Ice Ice Mickey*, *Little Red Rappinghood*, and *Ducks in the Hood*. I can for sure analyze that better than I can analyze baseball. |**55-46**
**12**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+5**| The Twins are having the hottest start to the second half of any team! Our bats are finally hot! The pitching is still working! We went to the west coast and didn't have a bad trip for once! This is starting to look like the team we were promised at the start of the year, and things are looking up.  |**53-48**
**13**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**0**| I'm sick of this Jim-and-Pam-ass will they/won't they team. Seemingly hellbent on riding the exact line between buying and selling, the Sox spent the last two weeks with an easy schedule *just* eeking out enough wins to maintain pace with the Yankees. At this point, as long as we get under the luxury tax, I really don't care what moves we make. There is (almost) no amount of buying at the deadline that will make us a top-3 AL contender, and the team is too close to a playoff spot to justify selling, even if it makes sense long-term. Who cares as long as Casas is hittin dingers and Duran is hitting infield doubles. |**53-47**
**14**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies were dangerously close to a disastrous week, but thankfully won a blown game Sunday to go 2-4 on the week. Nick Castellanos has gone ice cold and the offense has followed with him. Kyle Schwarber followed a 4 game home run streak by getting hits in 2 of his next 18 at bats. Bryce Harper played in the field for the first time since April 16 of last season, taking reps at 1B to prevent too much work on his arm. While the rotation has been far from what they could be, they are at least going deep into most games; Nola, Wheeler, and Walker particularly so. The trade deadline will be interesting as there isn't much they can add to their front lines without giving up a haul, potentially a big time pitcher or a LF/3B. |**53-46**
**15**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-2**|  |**53-47**
**16**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-7**|Pull the fucking trigger Kim. Im aware that we broke an 8 game losing streak last night. But, if this team had been losing in new ways since the start of the second half of the season i'd be all for not being buyers approaching the deadline. We have largely lost games because of the same problem weve had for the last 3 years: lack of slugging in the lineup. We have players that can get on base but we cant seem to drive them in. The pitching has rebounded after some horrendous outings from some our starters out the gate following the ASB. If our pitching was atrocious then id say dont buy but we if we get an impact bat we can start to make some serious noise. This week, we got two games in tampa followed by three games against the tigers at home.  |**54-47**
**17**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+3**| The only thing that people honestly care about with the Angels right now is the question of if Shohei Ohtani will be sold for scraps before the deadline. With just seven games left on the schedule before the August 1st deadline, the team will no doubt sit on the pot until the very end before decideding whether to shit or get off it. They are four games out of the Wild Card and conveniently have a three game series this week against the Blue Jays who are occupying that final berth. Anything less than a series win very well could be what pushes the team to move him. |**51-49**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| Winning the Canadian Invasion series is always a nice feeling, and so close to a sweep too. There's signs of life, so maybe just a new bat is allthis team needs with the majority of the AL flailing as well. Next up: Triplet @ Twins, 3 @ Snakes on a Plane (of grass and dirt) |**50-49**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| All the props to Jackson Wolf, who made his first career start this weekend, and earned a win, in a game where the Pads scored 14! With a week left, all eyes are on the upcoming deadline, I wonder to what extent the results of the next series's against the Pirates and Rangers will have on whether the Pads buy or Snell. |**48-52**
**20**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+1**| Led by Cody Bellinger's scorching form, the Cubs staved off selling for at least another week by going 5-2.  It now seems likely that the Cubs will  at least hold onto Bellinger, as he will be eligible for the QO should he stay and is the only Cub hitting for power. Unfortunately, just as Bellinger has heated up Marcus Stroman has gone cold. The Cubs will hope for him to recapture his early season form going forward, wether to increase his attractiveness as a trade chip or to help them in the playoff hunt, where they are only 5 games out of the Wild Card slot. Going forward, the Cubs will face the White Sox and Cardinals this week. |**48-51**
**21**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-2**| This week was the trade deadline week, so I got sent to the Marlins. They lost every game during the time I was sent there. Sorry if I jinxed you guys, Marlins fans. I did keep an eye on the Guardians though. They got swept by the Rangers and took 2 out of 3 against each Pennsylvania team. They're down three starters, so rookies keep having to come up and the bullpen is overworked. This is less than ideal. |**49-50**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**0**| Despite some brief flirts with a return to relevance, the Mets sit at 46-53 with their narrow window for a playoff berth rapidly closing. Starling Marte and Tommy Pham are hurt. Max Scherzer is back to looking fucked. I'm looking on the bright side here - the Mets won't have a repeat of 2021 where they incorrectly see themselves as contenders and trade a top prospect for a rental player. They will clearly be sellers at the Deadline, though I would expect the focus to be on selling expiring contracts like David Robertson and Tommy Pham rather than a total teardown. |**46-53**
**23**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+1**|  |**44-56**
**24**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-1**| 6-4 out of the All Star Break ain't too bad. Seven games out of first in mid July in a rebuild ain't too bad. But this team still needs to sell off expiring contracts and be vigilant on the waiver wire. This week: 1 vs. SF, 3 vs. LAA, 3 at MIA. |**45-54**
**25**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-2**| One of the few things that was going well for the Pirates this year was Mitch Keller, who owned a 3.25 ERA and 2.85 FIP through the first two months of the saeson and looked like the ace Bucco fans were promised. After a solid June, Keller got to pitch in the All-Star Game, where he gave up a home run in an inning. That made it his 2nd-best outing of the month, as he now has a 7.04 ERA in July. This past week was especially brutal: 8 runs against Cleveland with just 1 strikeout, and then 6 runs to the Angels, including 2 homers to Luis Renfigo. There is nothing good that the Pirates cannot destroy |**43-56**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Mike Rizzo &amp; Co need to make sure they deliver at the deadline. The Nats have several players who should be wearing new uniforms including All-Star in my heart Jeimer Candelario, The Hamburglar Carl Edwards Jr., Mets legend Dom Smith, and Jon Lester's final gift to the Nats Lane Thomas. If Lane Thomas continues with the Nats, it isn't the end of the world but I'm not sure his value is going to get any higher right now. |**41-58**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-1**| I just want to thank the White Sox for finally picking a lane and leaning into the tank. Of course it comes just as Tim Anderson starts to find himself again. In the next week, here's hoping the White Sox trade what valuable assets they have for what will assuredly be another failed rebuilding attempt (or, even worse, a poor re-tooling). The truly shocking thing is the franchise hitting a new low point during the middle of what should have been a contention window. |**41-60**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The Rockies came out of the all-star break swining, going 5-3, and winning series against two winning teams, the Yankees and Marlins.  There's also actual rumors of the Rockies making deals at the deadline and Pierce Johnson actually just got traded for prospects?  Whoa, the Rockies are looking like a normal baseball team for a little while. |**39-60**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| The only thing to look forward to is to find out which prospects the Royals are going to ruin by acquiring. Pitching? Not like the Royals can develop them. Hitters? It feels like there's some developmental meat left on the bones and talent isn't translating enough. Everything sucks. |**28-73**

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| [**No Blurb Submitted**] |**67-36**
**2**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**+1**| A winning week did little to stymie anxiety about stagnation before the deadline as other teams make moves. The Rays feel like they could use a boost to get back to that first half form, but maybe those unflappable FO flappers trust guys like BLowe to ramp back up. Maybe teams don't want to see their 5ERA reliever become a closer, who knows. A series against the Yankees this week is exactly what we need to calm the nerves, those games are never stressful. |**64-44**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| As I write this on Monday morning at 815am the Orioles have made no significant moves before the trade deadline. My gut feeling is that they either trade with the Cardinals or the Mariners for starting pitching. I know fans want them to trade away prospects and make a lot of moves, the problem is there isn't really that much out there. Especially now that Texas has really gone gangbusters. As a fan I have to keep telling myself this team is still ahead of schedule. Although they could make moves to improve themselves, would rentals set this team up for long-term success? The answer is no, but again I don't know much. We will see what happens in the next 48 hours. |**64-41**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| Scared money don't make money and the Texas Rangers are not scared, going all-in on the trade deadline by acquiring Max Scherzer, Jordan Montgomery, and Chris Stratton for 3 Top 10 prospects. Pitching has been the team's biggest hole this year, especially in the bullpen so adding reinforcements arms will hopefully help push this team to the post season. With only a game up on the Astros and after a middling June and July, It's going to be important to have a great end of the year. |**60-46**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**0**| The Dodgers continue to confound even the most seasoned of baseball experts by going all in on the trade deadline. By all in I mean getting two of the worst hitters in baseball and 2 pitchers who have been questionable so far this year. Maybe Friedman will work his magic in the last day of the trade deadline or turn these guys into studs. Maybe he's just insane. All I know is my boy Kiké is back and ready to do what he does best: troll. |**59-45**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| To reunite or to not reunite with Verlander, that is the question of the week. It's great that we got bullpen help with the return of Graveman, and losing Korey Lee doesn't hurt too badly since we have our catcher of the future waiting for Maldy to leave. Dana Brown seems to be prioritizing additional bullpen help - which isn't bad - and potentially a bat, but remains publicly noncommittal to the idea of acquiring a SP. We'll see what today and tomorrow bring. |**59-47**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| Great week that saw the Jays take 2-of-3 from the Dodgers and Angels, keeping the boys in the division hunt, somehow, and clinging to a wild card spot in what's going to be a crazy final stretch in the AL. The bullpen and rotation continues to throw up gems. Jordan Romano is headed to the 15-day with some lingering back issues, but the front office stepped up by snagging the best reliever on the market in Jordan Hicks. With Chad Green due back any day now, we're finally heading into a postseason chase with a pen full of swing-and-miss guys. If a few of the guys in the lineup continue to follow Kirk's recent run of resurgence to shore up that second third of the order, this team could be looking scary coming into September after what's promising to be a win-padding end of August with four straight series against the bottom of the league (COL, DET, OAK, WAS). But before we get there, we've got (HOPEFULLY) Revenge Week starting this week, with 4 vs BAL and 3 vs BOS, two teams that have owned us all year.  |**59-47**
**8**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+2**| A 43 week? A 4 -3 week. Taking a series from the talented Red Sox and the dubiously existent As is a good outcome. Giants fans will find many reasons to complain, mostly regarding the offense. Let me channel my inner Grant real quick: feckless, anemic, [insert 90s cultural quip]. The rookies arent really hitting anymore, the oldies are kind of hitting, and the result is about 2-3 runs a game while the pitching staff presumably props up local dive bars. Godspeed, bartenders. Id be scared to serve Logan Webb after a loss. Lets go to the numbers: 14th in MLB in Run Diff (-1 spot), 16th in RS/G (-3), 9th in RA/G (+4), 7th in Bullpen ERA (+2). I think we all knows whats wrong and August is an insane month. Tim Gunn would call this month a make it work moment. All the Giants do is play good teams or the As. Hit or go home, boys. Next up: 4 vs Snakes and 2 more @ As. 6 games  we want the Giants to win 3 to maintain. |**58-48**
**9**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| Hey guys, Ive had some stuff going on this week so I dont have time to type out some big long diatribe about whatever random thing that comes to mind, so Im just gonna quickly type out my thoughts on how we did this week. Anyway the Reds still cant beat the Brewers but we can beat the Dodgers, which just makes a ton of sense. Were done playing them though so theres some good news, along with our starting pitching which seems to be stabilizing. I still doubt that were going to make any big trades, I honestly dont even know what kind of trade could benefit us. So I think staying the course is the best option. Anyway like I said I dont have a lot of time today, but you know who else doesnt have a lot of time?

**10**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+3**|  |**56-49**
**11**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-2**| I keep reading rumours of Tyler Soderstrom to Milwaukee, but I just don't see how that can work.  With the addition Carlos Santana and Sal Frelick doing his best Robin Yount impersonation the big gap in the lineup is DH (an abysmal 55 wRC+ this season).  Eloy Jimenez would look real good right there, and he wouldn't even have to play the field if Milwaukee hates his glove.    With Wade Miley and Brandon Woodruff returning soon if Milwaukee goes for an arm it would be bullpen.  |**57-49**
**12**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-4**| The D'backs are in a freefall and have made no moves yet to improve a roster that has glaring needs. Injuries, slumps, and bad luck have turned one of the best offenses in the league into one that is struggling not to be shut-out on many nights. The rotation was thin beyond Gallen and Merrill Kelly even before the recent rash of injuries. The bullpen is a disaster.  |**56-50**
**13**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+1**| The Phillies won 2/3 against the AL best Orioles but lost 2/3 to the floundering Pirates. They're in a weird spot where something obviously has to change for them to kick it into a higher gear, but there aren't really any deadline moves that make sense that would actually upgrade their every day lineups. The target will likely be a right-handed corner OF/IF, with Mark Canha and Tommy Pham being the current top candidates. A 5th starter might make some sense, but Cristopher Sanchez is performing well and that spot doesn't exactly contribute come playoff time. This week is a big 4 game set in Miami with huge implications for the Wild Card, and a 3 game set against the Royals. |**56-49**
**14**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+2**| Marlins have been slowly getting out of the ASB funk, thank you jeebus. We took one game out of two against the rays and we took this series from the tigers. Avisail Garcia has come back from injury and made a statement in his first game. Well see if he plays better than he did in april moving forward. Ya boy got to see Dave Robertsons first close opportunity in a marlins jersey on sunday and he did not disappoint. Way to go Kim Ng, now please get us a slugger to help out this anemic offense. The phils are coming into town for 4 games and then the fish are going to texas. |**57-49**
**15**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+2**| While going to Toronto and losing the series with some uniquely awful umpiring and impossibly bad hitting with runners on base was just about the most predictable thing this team could have done, at least they didn't get swept. At least this team is making moves and going all-out to try and make it to the playoffs. I'm trying not to be cynical about it all, but for the past decade, any story with this team that has leaves you feeling good is simply a story that wasn't told to completion. Color me skeptical that is ever changing. There is only death and despair. Nothing is waiting for us after we die except an eternity of slowly being forgotten by anyone and anything else that we leave behind. I did like the trades though. |**55-51**
**16**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-1**| The Yanks had one of their worst two month stretches in recent decades, going five games below .500 since June 1st. If there's the faintest sliver of hope, it's that Judge is back, and the deadline looms. If you actually watch the games though (shit or even just check the box scores), it's hard to see what could be added to suddenly make this team a contender. The only real fix is if the existing corps magically starts hitting again, but I won't be getting my hopes up.  |**55-50**
**17**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+1**|  |**54-51**
**18**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+2**| A 5-1 week, albeit against two awful teams, has the Cubs above .500 for the first time since May. In all likelihood, this recent form means the Cubs won't be selling at the deadline as they are 4 and 3.5 games out of the division and Wild Card respectively. Surprisingly, this uptick has been led by the scorching hot offense which has been the best in baseball since the All Star Break. Additionally, Jameson Taillon finally found some much needed form in July, solidifying the rotation behind Marcus Stroman and Justin Steele. At the deadline, the Cubs seem likely to add a few relievers and desperately needed first base help. |**53-52**
**19**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-7**| Remember last week when everything was shiny and things were finally coming together? Yeah, then a 5-game losing streak happened. Including being swept by the Royals. |**54-53**
**20**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| Honestly, these last two weeks have been a bit annoying: after each and every result there's someone on twitter, etc, claiming now the pads will buy or sell, etc. Its generally  observed that people don't put too much into the stats and standings until at least june. At the same time, we're told that one of these late july games will force aj's hand. It's a bit ridiculous really, if a gm decides to buy over one good series, when the team (as it stands) is under .500! HSK, please be ok |**52-54**
**21**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| This week the Guardians have to play the Astros. We'll see how that goes. Last week they went 4-3 against two bad teams. I'm not sure what they'll do at the trade deadline, nor am I really sure what they should do. |**53-53**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**0**| The Mets have traded Max Scherzer and David Robertson and are firmly looking to the future. We will gain a lot of clarity in the coming days as to whether they consider that future to be 2024 or whether it's 2025 and beyond. Tommy Pham, Omar Narvaez, and Mark Canha are strong candidates to be traded either way, but a trade of Justin Verlander would telegraph the team going into a mini-rebuild of sorts. |**50-55**
**23**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**| As expected the Cards sold at the deadline; there are weaknesses in the roster but the team has a sickness to the spirit no move will cure. Fire Mozeliak. |**47-60**
**24**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+1**| The trade deadline is here, whcih means the Pirates are selling... again. Unless they really want to blow things up, though, there isn't a lot ot sell. Carlos Santana was already sent to Milwaukee for a lottery ticket prospect, and I can't imagine they'd get much more than that for Rich Hill or (lol) Austin Hedges. There have been rumors swirling about a potential David Bednar or Mitch Keller trade, but at some point Ben Cherington actually has to field a winner, and that would be harder next year if neither of those guys are employed by his team. |**47-58**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-1**| You know what time it is- Deadline Time! We'll see if Eduardo Rodriguez and Michael Lorenzen are on the move- potentially a reliever or two as well. Don't expect a strong return, but rather a top 100-200 prospect or so for some rentals.... but at least Al Avila isn't the one smashing accept on deals anymore! This week: 2 at PIT, 3 vs. TBR. |**47-59**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Shortstop A: .242/.294/.379 with 21 doubles, 10 HR, and 21 SBs in 103 games resulting in 1.1 WAR  Shortstop B: .256/.307/.418 with 18 doubles, 10 HR, and 24 SBs in 97 games resulting in 2.4 WAR  SELL SELL SELL |**44-62**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| I've spent the year waiting for the Sox to pick a lane after a disappointing start and middle. It's been a frustrating year because this team has been largely unwatchable, yet I've been watching. I'm happy that they've finally traded their chips, even though I'm expecting them to ""retool"" to ""compete"" next year. Personally, I have no hope that this front office can do anything right so it really doesn't matter if they rebuild or just put a bandaid on a sinking ship. |**43-64**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| No time for a blurb today, just know the Rockies are still bad. |**41-64**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| If I had a dollar for every time the Royals did something stupid, I could afford to move to Greenland. The latest? Trading Nicky Lopez for someone that Braves acquired for cash considerations not even a week ago. I get Lopez wasn't going to get much of a return, but that? Someone that was literally acquired for a few bucks? /sigh I miss when this team was competent. |**32-75**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| Gelof, Soderstrom, Diaz and (soon back from injury) Ruiz represent the first wave in the new, fun ""baby a's"" movement. None of these players are likely to be stars (diaz is rocking a 129 wRC+ this month though) but in the aggrigate, they could all combine for like 6ish wins for the next few years. This marks a fun chapter in losing a's baseball, where the vogt's and elvis's of the previous year are replaced by younger players. It's functionally the same bad losing team, but they're at least competitve vs. other equally bad teams. Oh and gelof has really killed it these first two weeks in the show.  |**30-77**","baseball",52,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15ere5h/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_18_red_sox_and/"

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Why replace writers with AI when the Rays bullpen has proven to be the most cost efficient way to generate drama in 2023? The team doing so well makes it hard to complain, but Jason Adam also makes it so easy, yanno? Happy pride month y'all! In other positive news, Glasnow has looked good if not otherworldly in his return, he'll look to continue finding his groove. Yandy Diaz also hit a quintessential little league homerun, which should make everyone everywhere happy! |**42-19**
**2**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| hahahahaha offense go brrrrrrrt. Big week this week with a series against the struggling Cardinals and then the big weekend matchup against the Rays. Ending another month on top of the division and we are having fun! |**38-20**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| Horrid start to the week by losing a series to the Oakland ""Triple A's"" (don't @ me...I heard their own annoucers call them that), but we salvaged the week in AZ thanks to Eddie Rosario playing OUT OF HIS MIND and capping off our weekend with a go ahead  Slam in the top of the ninth on Sunday. We are banged up on the hump, but are pushing through. If this is a rough patch, I am happy. First up this week is the Mets. A very important series to get it all back on track. |**35-24**
**4**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+2**| Crucial series win against the Angels to finish off the weekend. Saturday's game was a lot of fun, aside from the top of the 7th inning - but we don't talk about that. Let's talk instead about how Alex Bregman's grand slam, 4-walk day can be 100% attributed to his wife throwing out the first pitch (it was Girls Night Out) and Bregs subsequently skipping the photo op with her to finish his warm-up. |**35-24**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**|  |**35-25**
**6**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Alternating wins and loses all week this past week. Losing two out of the last three series is not great. I then thought about it and obviously the Orioles can't win every game and can't win every series, so thinking they can, means I have more confidence in this team than I have in a very long time. Aaron Hicks has been a pleasant surprise filling in for Cedric, batting .455 with an OPS of 1.208. Even though the fans were severely against getting him, he seems to have been the right move so far. The next six games are against Milwaukee and KC, hopefully we go at least 4-2. |**37-22**
**7**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**0**| Another strong road trip, another handful of injury questions. Is Nestor really hurt, or is this a get right phantom stint? Will Judge need IL time? Wtfs Baders situation? In better news Stanton, Kahnle, and Donaldson are back, and Rodon is set to face live batters. It would be really fucking cool if we could get off the IL merry-go-round though. |**36-25**
**8**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+1**| Very nice bouceback week(ish) after our AL East foes took us to Pound Town, with series wins over Minnesota and Milwauke (Algonquin for ""the good land"") before sweeping the Nye Mets. Bassitt continued to build on his '23 legend by nearly throwing another CGSO while his wife was going into labor in another country. Vladdy lasered his first HR not off a shitting-his-pants position player since May 4th, and still hasn't hit one at home, which is WILD. Belt overcame DFA screams from dipshits after an abysmal April (.519 OPS) with a hero-ball May (.940 OPS). Big tests coming up, tho, with HOU, BAL, MIN, and TEX next on the docket. Someone throw an irradiated spider at Manoah or something.  |**33-27**
**9**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-1**| The Diamondbacks had a decent week, sweeping the Rockies in four games and coming within one out of taking two of three from the Braves. Alas, the Diamondbacks' bullpen is still the Diamondbacks' bullpen. Additionally, Geraldo Perdomo's abysmal peripherals are catching up with his early-season performance, and third base remains a question mark, as Josh Rojas still doesn't have a single home run on the season.  |**35-25**
**10**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**0**| A 4-3 week, including another series win against the reigning WS Champions! The lineup still isn't consistent though and we're being carried by our good pitching. There's time to fix those issues as the summer goes on, especially in the AL Central where we don't have a lot of competition. |**31-29**
**11**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**| In the words of noted Brewers fan Tom, ""i don't understand how each day the lineup can look worse than the day before, like each day feels like rock bottom then it gets even worse somehow""    That's pretty much Brewers fandom opinion of the Spring Training esque lineups Milwaukee is trotting out day after day.  Somehow the team was 4-2 in the last week though.  (Thanks Reds).  Also, Reddit effectively kiling third party app support is terrible, and might actually be the thing that gets me to leave this Californian Hotel. |**32-27**
**12**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**0**| You know, I liked baseball more when we weren't .500. Losing Chris Sale to the injured list right as we get Whitlock and Paxton back is cruel but predictable. Our rotation has a lot of talent, but lacks the stamina to actually go deep into games. Houck, Whitlock, Pivetta and Kutter are all decent to really good 1st/2nd time through. Pair them up and have them each throw ~3-4 innings and you've basically Frankenstiened two 110 ERA+ starters! CHaim hire me please :) |**30-29**
**13**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+4**| The Pirates had a miserable May. The pitching went from excellent to merely good while the offense was put on life support. The Bucs, who were 20-9 at the end of April, had dropped under the .500 mark on Memorial Day. Since then, the Bucs have won 5 straight  2 against the Giants to pick up the Pirates' first (and only) series win in May, and then a sweep of the Cardinals for the first time since 2018. Yeah, the Pirates are only 31-27, but that puts them just a game out of first in the NL Central. Not bad considering where this team stood a week ago.  |**31-27**
**14**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| When he has been on the field and not getting into it with fans or wasting away on the injured list, Anthony Rendon has been a quietly solid presence in this Angels lineup. Slated to return back to the lineup within the next couple days, the team could use a boost in the middle part of the order, especially with runners on. |**31-30**
**15**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-4**| A Mariner is a person who works aboard a watercraft as part of its crew, and may work in any one of a number of different fields that are related to the operation and maintenance of a ship.  The profession of the Mariner is old, and the term Mariner has its etymological roots in a time when sailing ships were the main mode of transport at sea, but it now refers to the personnel of all watercraft regardless of the mode of transport, and encompasses people who operate ships professionally, be it for a military navy or civilian merchant navy, as a sport or recreationally.  Up next: 2 @ Vedder Cup bros, 3 @ Troutanis |**29-30**
**16**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| Since my last update, we swept the Phillies and we got swept by the Blue Jays. This is a weird Mets team who I think may just be pretty mediocre, though I suspect they'll stick sneak into the playoffs. Our record is back at .500 and we have the Braves in Atlanta next, which is not the kind of shit you want to see. Omar Narvaez will likely return from the IL this week, creating an interesting roster crunch which shouldn't be interesting at all, since current backup catcher Tomas Nido has an OPS of .278. |**30-30**
**17**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| [Sweepy](https://i.redd.it/gl13n0e3bf791.jpg) has been busy so far this year. The fish complete their 4th sweep of the season on the visiting A's, reports are sketchy but apparently he was last spotted saying ""Mets are over rated"". We'll get further clarification on what he meant by that next time he resurfaces. Sandy is going through it right now, if im being honest i think hes working through some mechanical issues cuz hes still lowkey struggling with location. His last outing was fairly good save one inning where he allowed a bunch of runs but he is slowly improving. Very slowly. The his week the marlins are gonna host the royals, followed with a trip to south side chicago. |**32-28**
**18**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-2**| The Giants went 24 with two 1-run losses. Normally losing a series to both the Orioles and Pirates would be problematic, but in the New Age, both teams are good and the Giants played hard 80% of the time. They are 57 in 1-Run Games, and 1-2 in extras, and with a +1 Run Diff (18th in MLB, -5 spots) they are slightly underperforming expected W/L Record. The Giants will be without Joc, Yaz, Conforto, Estrada, and Bart until tomorrow (expected), and Alex Wood is the latest casualty  gone for 12ish days. The rotation, led by Cobb, Webb, and Disco, will rely even more on the bullpen which usually means Jacob Junis (yay!) and Manaea (: / ). Cleaning up their act some, the bullpen ERA is now 20th in MLB (+3) and the whole staff at 15th in RA/G (=).  The inconsistent offense, hampered by injuries and some mini-slumps, sits at 14th in RS/G (-2). Giants fans must hope a return to health will boost the bats, the younglings liven back up, and the bullpen holds the line @ Coors Field ( : / ) and vs the question-mark-of-a-team Chicago Cubs. |**29-30**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| It was the first game at Petco for my Niece and her Father. He'd long written off the Padres, as a team of nobodies that would never try to win at a sport that ultimatley rigged for markets that weren't in San Diego County. As a sign of goodwill from my Sis, his ex-wife, they had amazing seats, down by the first base side, that were each in the triple digits. Over the last few years he'd gotten into the sport for the first time since '98, and for my Niece, it was the first time following any pro sport in her life. They sat down at their beautiful seats, had a couple of 'dogs, and by the third inning, San Diego was behind 7-0. Sigh. The Padres average 39k at Petco, ranking 5th in the majors in attendance. They have a 13-17 record in those games. |**27-32**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**+3**| I was on vacation this week, so I haven't been as aware of baseball as I should be. I did go to two games at Camden and two at Nationals Park while on my trip. The Guardians won a series against the Orioles and split one with the Twins, so now I'm being optimistic and will probably embarrass myself again. Also, I hope the Reds ranker is doing okay. |**27-32**
**21**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| What a miserable week it was to be a Phillies fan. They salvaged a 2-4 record by winning the weekend games against the Nationals, but were dreadful all week in games that were just close enough to keep your hopes up. The Phillies are currently 4.5 games out of the 3rd wild card spot with 3 other teams ahead of them. Trea Turner, who you'd think would have one of the highest floors in the league, is hitting .232 with a dreadful .276 OBP. Alec Bohm hit the IL, which means the infield regularly includes one or two of Josh Harrison, Kody Clemens (who's actually been quite hot the past few weeks), and AAAA quality Drew Ellis (who went 3/3 with 2 walks and 2 home runs on Sunday). The bats and pitching have completely died, but that's thankfully set the stage for Nick Castellanos to do what he does best. This week: a homestand with 3 against the Tigers and 3 against the Dodgers. |**27-32**
**22**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+2**| This week was a much needed bounce back for the Cubs, as they took 2 out of 3 from both the Rays and Padres. Unfortunately, the week was marred by yet more struggles in the clutch and with RISP as well as Justin Steele's injury. Steele is out for at least 2 starts with forearm soreness, and will be dearly missed as he has kept the Cubs in game after game. The Cubs continue their West Coast road trip this week with sereis against the Angels and Giants following today's game in SD. |**26-32**
**23**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-2**| The Cardinals should be playing better, they aren't. They've been bad all season. Short of collective epiphany that sees them 30 up in their next 40 (lol, doubt it) there's no useful information I can put in this box past ""Fire John Mozeliak.""  |**25-35**
**24**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+1**| It finally happened boys. After just a month of being separated, she gave me official divorce papers. I think shes made it abundantly clear she has no interest in fixing things, and you know what? I get it. Its alright. She told me straight up that she didnt feel anything between us anymore, and no amount of therapy or counseling is gonna fix that, whatever was there is gone. Shes felt like that for a while, I just refused to see it, I was in denial. But im not anymore. Im free, I am once more ready to set sail on the ocean of loneliness until I find land. I hope I can find land. I gotta find land. How well divide time between our son is yet to be determined, but I know well find a good compromise. Im just&happy that the air is clear. No more pretending to enjoy each other's presence, no more fake smiles to mask our emptiness. No more. Anyway, lets talk Reds baseball. We had a good road trip where our offense managed to shine but a horrid home series where we got pantsed by a division rival. The front office just refuses to throw the fans a bone. We continue to give playing time to people like Will Benson and Stuart Fairchild, all the while prospects like Elly De La Cruz and Christian Encarnacion-Strand are tearing up AAA to the point where theres really nothing left for them to do. Both had problems with their Walk%, so what happened? The last couple weeks both have significantly improved their walk rate. They have nothing left to do in AAA if you ask me and plenty of the fanbase. Imagine if both can be successful in the MLB, what kind of boost of energy that would give to this team while theyre still in striking distance of the NL Central crown. Our starting pitching is still a major liability, Graham Ashcraft has just flat out forgotten how to pitch. The Bullpen is still keeping us in games and our offense can be truly clutch at times, but consistency is one thing weve lacked all season. Consistency, consistency, consistency. Its not here. But with an injection of young talent, things could definitely turn around, or I guess you could say something thats become a bit of a motto here in Cincinnati and with our recent ownership groups: Were just a couple years away. |**26-33**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-3**| RIP Riley Greene. RIP Eduardo Rodriguez. I guess the White Sox walkoff on Saturday where a Jose Cisnero pitch domed the home plate umpire for a wild pitch was emblematic of this week (shrugs). As a side note, man is this linup brutal, sporting a team slash line of .226/.302/.349 for the season. Yikes! This week: 3 at PHI, 3 vs. ARI. |**26-31**
**26**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**+2**| The AL Central being so competitive/non-competitive is the worst thing for the White Sox right now. Despite being 9 games under .500, they are only 5.5 games back in the division. They're stuck in limbo right now. In any sane world, they would already be selling parts, but in all likelihood, they'll have to sell some of the future at the deadline, only to go on a cold streak in mid September, finish 8 games out in the division, and make this awful season feel even worse. |**26-35**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Rough week for the Nats losing 5 of 7 and getting even worse news with the announcement of Strasburg being shut down from all physical activity. While I can't speak for all Nats fans, I can speak for myself: Stephen Strasburg has absolutely nothing to prove. I genuinely would be ecstatic for him to ride off into the sunset without throwing another pitch before unvailing a statue with Zim on the corner of Capitol and Potomac. |**25-34**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-1**| **No Blurb Submitted**  |**26-35**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Congo rats to Scott Barlow on notching his 50th career save. And congo rats to Aroldis Chapman for rebuilding his career and being a trade chip. The Royals are going to fuck up the return, but at least he can get something back in another couple of months. I'm looking forward to surgery so I can be too drugged up to give a shit about this team. |**18-41**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| More a question than a curse, how could hell be any worse? |**12-49**","baseball",60,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/141rjl4/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_10_quest_for_1/"

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**+0**| BREAKING: #r/tampabayrays u/double_dose_larry says u/pkrocking199x is not doing power rankings tonight and at least next week as well stemming from way he handles his frustrations and not being a better teammate. Larry also stressed u/pkrocking199x is a good kid and they will work with him to improve. Rays look to put their mediocre week behind them as they tackle a challenging west coast trip against the D-Backs and Mariners this week. |**54-27**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| I hate putting the Braves at number 1, but you can't argue with the results. 4-1 this week against two playoff contenders including a series win against the suddenly incredible Reds. The Braves are 17-3 in their last 20 games and are flirting with Tampa (who are 5-5 in their last 10 compared to 9-1 for the Braves) for the best record in baseball. This is without Max Fried and Kyle Wright, both who could return at some point this season. We also should see Soroka back on the hump this week. If he can pitch like a decent fifth starter and we can get Wright and Fried back to their old ways if they both return (we already know what our offense can do...) we should be WS favorites. So, I had to put them at number 1. Here's my problem: every time I have put the Braves at #1 in my history as a Power Rankings voter, they have had a HORRIBLE week the next week. If that happens, please feel free to roast me...and know that it will NEVER happen again. |**50-27**
**3**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| Opening a 17 straight game strech by dropping a winnable series to the Yankees by leaving everyone on base doesn't exactly exude confidence. Next up is a series against Detroit and a big one against Houston this week, will give this team the chance to bounce back. |**47-30**
**4**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| If you had Ryan McKenna and Anthony Bemboom as the hitters who would produce game winning RBI in 2 wins this weekend against the Mariners, then please give me the lottery numbers.  Not a great week as the O's went 4-3 but Mullins came back and today marks the Jordan Westburg era.  The roster is getting very crowded, especially the infield.  O'Hearn (until Mountcastle comes back), Urias, Mateo, Henderson, Fraizer and now Westburg.  There will have to be some moves made, a big one when Mountcastle comes back, and with Hicks doing so well at the plate it should be interesting to see how Hyde maneuvers this lineup.  Either way on pace for 100 wins almost halfway through the season.  I'll take it. |**47-29**
**5**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**0**|  |**47-32**
**6**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+3**| The Giants just said Hi to the NL West and swept the Dodgers, took 3 of 4 from the Padres, and 2 from the DBacks. Theyre playing good teams, theyre winning, and the only problem is I cant afford Netflix anymore so Im stuck on Season 6 of Greys Anatomy indefinitely. Well, one other problem  the injuries are continuing and, to be honest, Im kind of over it. I cant prove it, but Im pretty sure were on the 4th string Lou Seal. However, LUIS MATOS hit his first career homerun, Bailey Patrick continues his GDBPIII impersonation, and the bullpen continues to be a rock. Does anyone know where Ross Stripling or Joey Bart is? Anyway, since last week I spent so much time talking about Doctors Without Boundaries, lets look at the numbers: 45 Run Diff is 5th in MLB (very good), 8th in RS / G (above expectations), 14th in RA / G (little below expectations), 11th in Bullpen ERA (basically what we expected). Whats next? A blessed off day, then Giants head to Canada to eat some poutine and probably play baseball and then its the Mets to finish off a road trip.  Giants are hot, but the Blue Jays are good and the Mets are ???  3 wins this week should make every Giants fan happy. |**44-34**
**7**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| Dodgers went 4-1 this week against formidable opponents in the Angels and Astros. The last couple games still show that the Dodgers still have some pitching problems but the series against the Angels showed that the bullpen is actually capable of pulling through.  |**43-34**
**8**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-1**| The Astros really don't seem to want to play good baseball right now. Frustration with Dusty is reaching a fever pitch and I don't think Drew Barrymore is going to come running from center field with heels on to save us. Who would've thought it wouldn't be fun to not be entirely dominant for once? |**42-36**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+2**| Things are starting to turn around nicely! Series wins vs MIA and OAK made up a solid week that should set us up for a much friendlier stretch before the  All Star Game, but most importantly, VLADDY FINALLY HIT A HOME RUN AT HOME. Our great national nightmare is over. He's been heating up again along with a few other key contributors (Varsho, Chapman, Biggio), and we've also got good news on the pitching front, with Ryu and Chad Green due to be back in the next month or so to bolster a very strong rotation and bullpen. If Manoah can also get somewhat back to form, they'll have the depth to actually make this playoff run happen. A red-hot SF team comes into town next, followed by BOS for a good test of a week. |**43-36**
**10**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**0**| The Yankees somehow took 2/3 from Texas, but all the same problems are still glaring. Despite the pitching remaining very good, this offense continues to struggle youre not going to win many 1-0 games. Also Judge will either be back in a month or three months or never walk again, who fucking knows.  |**43-35**
**11**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| Marlins have continued their hot streak through june (must be taking note from the weather, not looking forward to august temps) and have gotten to the best start to this point in the season since the late 2000s. The starting pitching has been absolutely phenomenal, quick shout out to Byran Hoeing (yes thats his real name) who has put together two absolute gems in his outings as a starter. Getting goose eggs from an emergency 5th starter is wild. He might not get an opportunity to be a long term starter on this team with some of the minor league arms that are right around the corner for the fish but hes certainly making a case for his ability as a starter. The offense has been clutch in certain points but still lackluster overall aside from Arraez, Soler, de la cruz and (surpringly) joey wendle. Jazz is pretty close to being done rehabbing in the minors and should provide a much needed boost to the offense. Oh, also, eury perez is the fuckin truth.  |**45-34**
**12**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-4**| So much happened in just one week: The Angels outscored their opponents 32-16, traded for two veteran infielders having above-average offensive seasons, Mike Trout rounded back into form with two home runs, Shohei had 12 strikeouts over 7 innings, and the team finished the week, all things considered, a respectable 1-4.  |**42-37**
**13**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+6**| Ive been sitting here for days. These divorce papers are laughing at me. The Reds keep winning though. Why? WHY? Something about it isnt natural. Theres something wrong here. Ive been feeling it a lot lately, you know those moments where youre experiencing something and it suddenly feels like you had dreamt that exact moment? Thats been happening every day now for a week. All the while these divorce papers are staring at me. Taunting me. I cant sign them, Id be signing away years of my life making everything utterly pointless. Its like the Reds, whats been the point? We spent years losing endlessly, for nothing. Our current success is almost exclusively because of decisions made recently, we spent years being utter shit for nothing, I want to know what the point has been. There is no point isnt there? Just like these rankings, theres no point, this is supposed to be fun power rankings, but I turned it into a way to complain about my life and the state of things around me. Im sorry, its my fault, Ive let you all down. What happened to fun? What happened to the enjoyment we all felt towards each others company? Its gone, I've lost it all. You just want to read what the Reds have been up to lately dont you? Okay, I get it. The Reds have been winning a lot more than normal. Our starting pitching is still terrible and our bullpen is starting to feel the weight of their workload. Just like how Ive been feeling the weight of my failed marriage every time I draw breath. Im sorry guys, Ive let you all down. Im sorry. I promise next week this blurb will try to be normal. |**41-37**
**14**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**| A 4-3 week isn't enough to stop hovering at .500, and it's time to start paying attention to the Guardians nipping at our heels. Two extra-inning wins, and finally seeing signs of life from the offense are promising though. It really is time for this team to start putting everything together, our lineup has too many good players to not break out soon. |**40-39**
**15**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| The Phillies went 2-3 this week, losing 2 to the Braves and winning 2/3 from the Mets. The offense has been simply terrible. Since scoring 15 against the Diamondbacks on June 14, the Phillies have averaged just under 4 runs per game. JT Realmuto, Alec Bohm, and Kyle Schwarber were ineffective turnstiles for most of the week. The elite bench of Kody Clemens, Josh Harrison, and Cristian Pache is laughably bad, even with better options in the minors for the first two. The team's OPS is almost 100 points lower with RISP vs not, and 51 solo home runs compared to 28 multi-run home runs with only a couple hundred more plate appearances for the former. Despite this, the deadline goals should still be pitching. Dylan Covey and Jeff Hoffman continue to get innings, and the 5th starter is still not solved with Cristopher Sanchez. Paul Goldschmidt would be nice, but they shouldn't give up Painter, Abel, or McGarry. |**40-37**
**16**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| Boston is doing a serious stress test on its roster depth as the injuries pile up. Pivetta and Crawford have both snuck back into the rotation, we're rolling out career .050 hitter Caleb Hamilton as our backup catcher, and the legend himself *BOBBY DALBEC* is back to take the helm as a gold glove SS. Losing back to back series against MIN and CWS isn't suprising given this. Thankfully, the Sox this season are always the opposite of what you think they are, so given that I think they're bad right now, they're probably going to sweep Miami and take two out of three @ TOR. |**40-39**
**17**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| I'm just happy to say I'm not an odds maker, because if I were, the NL Central might make me a very bankrupt bookie very quickly.  Somehow the Brewers are still hanging around even though the division crown is a game of hot potato between the Reds/Pirates/Brewers.    The team has been fairly okay from the pitching department, but should be looking to pickup a good(ish) bullpen arm and for the love of god somebody that can hit at least .230.. Or find a way to return Jesse Winker to his Reds version |**40-37**
**18**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+3**| While the Cubs' hot streak continued with a 4-1 week, they only made up a game in the standings due to the Reds' continued scorching form. The Cubs continue to win games off of elite pitching and just enough timely hitting. Unfortunately, Marcus Stroman exited Sunday's game in London with a blister issue; his health is paramount to continued success. The Cubs this week play the Phillies in Chicago before traveling to Cleveland. |**37-39**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| The Giant series broke me, man. Just not enough depth in the lineup, or clutch hitting with Risp. I'm not an expert to know exactly how to fix it, but this team can't be looked at by just drooling at the potential, and wave away criticisms to to expect them to suddenly turn it on and make a run. At some point you are what your record says you are, right? This is a team that is in 4th place with a losing record.  |**37-41**
**20**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-2**| *It was the best of games, it was the worst of games, it was the age of 23 runs in two games, it was the age of nothing doing in the other four, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the summer of despair.*    At least the M's will have a new plaque on Eutaw street, with Cal Raleigh to join the hallowed company of Ken Griffey, Jr. and... Sam Haggerty?   Up next: 3 vs. the other Washington, 3 vs. Florida Men (AL)  |**37-39**
**21**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**+1**| The Guardians swept the Athletics this week, but that series was a bit too close for comfort. They also went 1-2 against the Brewers, which was a disappointment, but not a surprise. Will they EVER break 500? Stay tuned. |**37-40**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+1**| The main outstanding questions are whether the 2023 Mets are the most disappointing team in MLB history, to what extent they sell at the trade deadline. The team stinks. The Brewers and Giants are probably going to rise in my rankings next week after each getting to play a series against the Mets. |**35-42**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-3**| The Pirates started 20-8. Since then, they've played at a 112-loss pace and have fallen from first place in the NL Central to within 3 games of last place. Despite their red-hot start, the Bucs are now on pace to finish with 74 wins, which is below the team's pre-season projection. The lineup is one black hole after another, and one of the few brights spots on offense is a 36-year-old DH who had to beg the team to sign him. Things are going well in Year 4 of Ben Cherington's Rebuild.  |**35-42**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**| The Cards didn't get swept in London, and that's the best we could hope for. Fire Mozeliak. |**32-45**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| Honestly, I didn't watch more than a few innings this past week as I was at the College World Series (watching hopefully the future Tiger Wyatt Langsford). Nick Maton was sent down to Toledo and hopefully arms and outfielders are back soon. Sorry, don't have too much more this week. This week: 4 at TEX, 3 at COL. |**33-43**
**26**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| Last week I asked the White Sox to pick a lane and fall out of the race or shorten the lead from 5.5 games. They responded by, uh, dropping to 6.0 games back. THIS IS NOT WHAT I MEANT. And it is absolutely disrespectful that Luis Robert, Jr. isn't even in the top 20 in ASG voting when he is TOP 10 in fWAR for the whole league! It should not be a surprise to anyone that, per Codify, the White Sox are at the bottom of the league in drop in home attendance by a significant margin when the organization seems to actively disdain the fans. (Side note: I had a much more fun time last week when I was traveling and riding The Beast, Lightning Rod, Fury 325 and Copperhead Strike than I've had all year watching the White Sox play) |**34-45**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Josiah Gray and MacKenzie Gore were excellent this weekend and the Nationals won. Jake Irvin and Trevor Williams have been quite servicable and the Nationals were competitive. Patrick Corbin has been deplorable and the Nationals were blown out. |**30-47**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The 25-1 game against the Angels really sums up how it feels to be a Rockies fan.  Because I kept watching the whole game, not hoping the Rockies were going to come back or even score any runs or do anything good at all, but because I wanted to see how bad it could get. |**31-49**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Thanks to Jack and the admins for covering for me over the past two weeks. Remember to check in with people - even the ones that make it a point to be laughing and smiling and trying to make everyone feel better. RIP little buddy - I'll see you again one day. |**22-56**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| Seven game winning streak? Meet eight game losing skid. The pitching has been remarkably better (until Sunday), but now the offense sucks |**20-60**","baseball",63,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/14jub74/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_13_stability/"

Last year was one of the easiest times I've had figuring out who on the fringes of ballot consideration would be on and who wouldn't. A clear line of demarcation revealed itself to me that had A.J. Pierzynski and Prince Fielder making the ballot and Michael Bourn and Kyle Lohse getting left off. Not sure how to explain it other than the vibes were very clear. Wasn't the case this year. My possible ballot additions list could have been eighteen players long, or six. Would the Screening Committee smile upon Yunel Escobar? How would they view Andre Ethier? Could Aaron Hill make it on? What about Jayson Werth? Until the ballot came out, these questions were unanswered. But probably the name I will-he-won't-he'd over the most was Carlos Ruiz. A man with a great story, a World Series ring, multiple accolades to his name, and who played on one team for over a decade, not to mention the highest HOF monitor of any newcomer catcher this year. But also someone with under 1000 career hits, only one All-Star Game, zero Gold Gloves, zero Silver Sluggers, and who had less career WAR and a much worse offensive profile than the other catcher who might make it on. Ballot gets revealed, and it turns out Mike Napoli made it on and Carlos Ruiz didn't. Statistically, there's many reasons this was the right call. Napoli had 1125 hits and 267 home runs to Ruiz's 935 and 71, he played in 3 World Series to Ruiz's 2, and he appeared in over 250 more games. But there's just something about it that I don't feel is right. Some aura is given off by Ruiz's career that whispers to me ""this man should be on the Hall of Fame ballot."" I don't know why. Let's talk about that career of his.

Carlos Ruiz did not have a normal road to the Majors. After a tragic accident took the life of his father when he was just seven years old, Carlos, the eldest of his mother's three sons, was thrust into the role of ""man of the house"" at an age much too young. His get-up-and-go-itude increased exponentially not because of drive, but because of necessity. Either he worked and provided or his family starved. Incredibly, he not only did enough to make ends meet for his family, but found time to organize local baseball meetups among the kids in his community. Ruiz was the one who picked the teams, picked where each kid was gonna go, and then slotted himself in at his natural position: second base. When he was 19, he got the opportunity to travel to the Dominican Republic to attend the Phillies Baseball Academy over there. Given his acumen for direction and putting things into place, the people in charge of the academy tried him out behind the plate, where he could direct to his heart's content. Ruiz, however, was unsure he could do anything at the position, considering the crop of players he was up against. He reportedly felt like a 10-year-old among men when everyone else was a head above and he stood at a diminutive 5'10"". Which kinda boggles my mind because like, that's not short? What behemoths were Chooch trying out with? Anyway, he eventually signed with the Phillies for $8,000, equivalent to several years' salary of the jobs he'd worked as a kid. After some more time spent at the academy, he'd eventually progress to the point they promoted him to the rookie leagues. In the year 2000, at the age of 21, Carlos Ruiz would play his first professional baseball season.

Serving as the primary catcher for the GCL Phillies, Ruiz's first year didn't go half-bad. 38 games, 11 baserunners gunned down, .277/.329/.369 at the plate, and promotion. Took him a couple years to get promoted again, but he found his way into a full season as a backstop with the double-A Reading Phillies in 2004. There, Ruiz showed off a new skill he learned during the offseason: putting the ball into the outfield seats. After hitting just 14 long balls in his first 270 minor league games, he cranked 17 of em in 101 games that season. Earned himself another promotion too, this time to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of AAA. While playing for what I can only assume is the only pro baseball team to ever have both a slash and a hyphen in its name, Ruiz was pretty good. He threw out 29% of prospective bag swipers and batted .300/.354/.458. But he only managed 56 starts at catcher, with 40 or so more appearances coming in mostly as a pinch-hitter. He did get a nickname out of it when a wise guy teammate started calling him ""Chooch"" since he often muttered ""chucha,"" a strong Panamanian curse word, under his breath. In 2006, two things happened that really helped Chooch's future. One, the guy above him on the depth chart got hired by the Arizona Diamondbacks to not play baseball anymore. And two, when he took over for that guy (whose name was and still is AJ Hinch), Ruiz remembered how to hit home runs. 16 dingers in 100 games with the Red Barons in 2006. And it would've been more had he not been called up to the Majors for 27 games. His first stint there started at the beginning of May, but after going 5-for-35 in 14 games, it concluded at the end of May. Then he came up for a couple games against the Padres, showed he wasn't a slouch by going 4-for-10 with his first big league home run off Clay Hensley, and got sent back down after Mike Lieberthal got healthy again. Then in September, he got called up as part of roster expansion, and was given five starts. In those five starts, he went 9-for-21 with a double, a triple, and two home runs. Had that hot streak to end the year not happened, I don't think Carlos Ruiz would be here. For you see, at this point, he was 27 years old. Age-wise, his entire saga took place about three years later than it was supposed to. And if he didn't show all the potential a guy as old as he was could exhibit for those five games in September, the Phillies may very well have moved on. After all, they still had Lieberthal, future Phillies Wall of Fame member, to take care of business behind the plate, as well as an effective backup in 33-year-old rookie Chris Coste. For times beyond the immediate, they had encouraging recent 2nd-round pick Jason Jaramillo right behind Ruiz, and a promising youngster with an 80-grade name in Tuffy Gosewisch right behind Jaramillo. It was Ruiz's sixth year as a pro, and if Philadelphia really wanted to, they could cast him to free agency. But five games of great hitting made them reconsider. Maybe they had their catcher of the future right here. After all, he would make league minimum for a couple more years, and considering that Lieberthal was a pending free agent, Ruiz would be cheaper than bringing him back. As great as the two-time All-Star Lieby had been for the franchise, he was 34, and wasn't getting any younger. That winter, the Phillies made a decision: they bet on Ruiz, and let their catcher of the last 12 years sign with the Dodgers in free agency. Not to spoil anything, but Philadelphia made the right choice.

In 2007, for the first time in the past decade, the catcher for the Phillies on Opening Day wasn't Mike Lieberthal. It wasn't Carlos Ruiz either. It was Rod Barajas, whom Philly had signed in the offseason. Ruiz didn't like this one bit, and complained about it by clobbering baseballs. Over the team's first 22 games, Ruiz hit .322/.344/.475, and Barajas hit .160/.344/.160. The Phillies decided Ruiz would be their starting catcher for the immediate future. Presumably Barajas's plea of ""our OBPs are equal though"" fell on deaf ears. Time passed, and all of a sudden Ruiz had been the starting catcher for the whole season. The Phillies went through 2007 with a 28-year-old rookie behind the plate for 2 out of every 3 games. And it worked like a charm. Ruiz wasn't anything special, either as a catcher or a batter, but he didn't have to be. His 87 OPS+ was middle-of-the-pack when it came to catchers, but since he shared a lineup with these fellas you mighta heard of named Ryan Howard, Aaron Rowand, Chase Utley, and a some guy Jimmy Rollins who went and won hisself an MVP that year, it was good enough. His catching was also solid, but not exactly close to Russell Martin or Yadier Molina. Then again, when the guys throwing to you are guys like 4th-place-finisher-in-that-year's-Rookie-of-the-Year-voting Kyle Kendrick and 6th-place-finisher-in-that-year's-Cy-Young-voting Cole Hamels, solid will do. Because Ruiz was on a team that featured an explosive offense and excellent pitching, they won 89 games. And that 89-game win total was the most of anybody in the NL East. Carlos Ruiz was going to the playoffs in his rookie year. While it would only last three games on account of Rocktober, Ruiz did his best to make it last longer than that, going 3-for-9 with a double and a stolen base. Getting swept out of the NLDS ain't exactly what everyone aspires to when they make it to the MLB, but Ruiz wasn't done. The next season would be different. For one, Ruiz started at catcher on Opening Day. For another, looking at his numbers on the season, he didn't do all that well. .219/.320/.300 is definitely below the bar he'd set the previous year, especially when his defense stayed the same. Nobody wishes on a star for a catcher with a 63 OPS+. But importantly, one other thing that changed in 2008 was that instead of winning 89 games, the Phillies won 92. With a lineup that was as consistent as ever (Ruiz's off year notwithstanding), a rotation that held the fort (including a Cole Hamels who had the lowest WHIP in the NL), and a bullpen that took a big step from pedestrian to elite (hi Brad Lidge), Philadelphia maintained their hold on the NL East crown, making the playoffs for the second straight year. But this year, things were different. They won their faceoff with the Brewers in the NLDS in four games, allowing just 9 runs across the entire series. Having won with pitching, they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS with batting, scoring 25 runs across the five-game series. Ruiz crossed the plate three times in the NLCS, a welcome change from the 1-for-14 showing he put up in the previous series. And thanks in part to those three runs, the Phillies were going to face the Tampa Bay Rays in the World Series. And it was there Ruiz revealed the year-long plan he'd concocted: he'd been saving all his batting power for the Fall Classic. If Cole Hamels hadn't won the Series MVP for keeping his team in line for victory in two very important games, it could've gone to Jayson Werth for going 8-for-18 with 3 RBIs and 4 runs, or maybe Ryan Howard for hitting three home runs in the series. But for my money, if a batter was gonna win it, it should've gone to Carlos Ruiz. For one, he was the guy catching Cole Hamels. For another, he batted in run number 3 in Game 1 that ended in a 3-2 Phillies victory, then batted in run number 5 in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 that finished as a 5-4 Phillies victory. Throw in a homer he hit earlier in Game 3, a stolen base, and four walks to zero strikeouts as a batter across the series, and I think he had a pretty good case. After a year where it seemed like his hitting had left him, Carlos Ruiz found his bat exactly when he needed to, and because of that, he earned himself and the rest of his team a World Series ring. This Phillies team sure seemed like it had just started something great. And Ruiz was part of that something. Time for that something to go win a bajillion more championships.

Over the next four years, nobody would care that Carlos Ruiz was 28 years old in his rookie year. He was playing like he'd always been in the show. His bWAR total of 14.2 over those four seasons is the third highest total among all catchers in the league over that time, only behind these two dudes named Yadier Molina and Joe Mauer. Over that same time period, Molina and Mauer combined for seven All-Star appearances, six Gold Gloves, two silver sluggers, and three top-5 MVP finishes, which included one top-1 MVP finish. And if that's what the only two catchers who are better than you are doing, that's a pretty good sign. Fangraphs is less kind since it likes how Brian McCann and Russell Martin whispered falsehoods into the ears of umpires during this same timeframe, but he was still a top-10 catcher for those combined seasons. He averaged - *averaged* - a season at the plate with these numbers: .292/.380/.448, 122 OPS+, 37 XBH, 10 HR, 51 RBIs, 45 BB, 48 K. Again, that was his average for those years. Shouldn't surprise you to hear he found his way on at least a couple MVP ballots for three of those seasons. And that's all just to tell you about how good he was on average as a batter. Because he was also a catcher. A catcher for some of the greatest rotations of all time. In 2009, while there weren't a great deal of bright spots in the rotation, rookie lefty J.A. Happ and trade deadline get Cliff Lee both did very well, tossing three shutouts between them. Who caught all three of those shutouts? Carlos Ruiz. Pedro Martinez got brought on for one last ride, tossing 8 innings of shutout ball in his third-to-last-ever regular season start, and 7 innings of two-hit ball in his lone career NLCS start. Who caught him both those times? Carlos Ruiz. In 2010, Roy Halladay was brought aboard, and threw a perfect game in May and a no-hitter in the NLDS, unanimously winning the NL Cy Young and finishing 6th in MVP voting. Who caught all but three of his starts, including both the perfecto and the playoff no-no? Carlos Ruiz. In 2011, the Phillies assembled quite possibly the greatest starting rotation of all-time, with Halladay and Hamels being joined by Roy Oswalt and the return of Cliff Lee to form the Four Aces, with NL Rookie of the Year Finalist Vance Worley filling in the final slot. Who started 113 of that team's games at catcher? Carlos Ruiz. All three of those teams went to the playoffs, and you don't need me to tell you who started every single one of those playoff games behind the dish. And even though the 2009 team won the pennant, the 2010 team had home field advantage in the NLCS, and the 2011 team set the franchise record with 102 wins in the regular season, all of them fell short of repeating what the 2008 team did. In 2009 the Phillies fell in the World Series to the Yankees, in 2010 they lost to the Giants who went on to win the World Series, and in 2011, against all odds, they lost to a St. Louis Cardinals team that only just made it into the playoffs, but who beat the Phillies in the postseason, which meant they also won the World Series. The Phillies went from winning the World Series, to losing the World Series, to losing the series before the World Series, to losing the series before the series before the World Series. Series series series series series. What an odd word. Wait, Carlos Ruiz. Yes. Let's talk about him some more. Where were we? 2012. Got it. 

So in 2012, the Phillies went from unstoppable juggernaut to fallible baseball team who had good players except all of them were injured. Halladay appeared human for the first time in a while, Cliff Lee got terrible run support, and even though he, Cole Hamels, and newcomer Jonathan Papelbon did their best, they couldn't do enough to keep the once-vaunted Phillie pitching from falling into mediocrity. Meanwhile on the other side of the ball, Chase Utley only played in 83 games, Placido Polanco looked like every one of his 36 years, and to call Ryan Howard a shell of his former self would be much too generous. And it was in this quagmire that Carlos Ruiz decided to have the best season of his career. Chooch led the National League in batting average as late as July, hitting .350 at the All-Star break. With more than a couple people clamoring for the newly-minted NL version of Joe Mauer to start the All-Star Game at catcher, Ruiz would lose out on the fan vote to Buster Posey. He did wind up with an invite and wound up getting to play, helping maintain an 8-0 shutout of the AL All-Stars with some assistance from his teammates and fellow All-Stars Hamels and Papelbon. While he wouldn't finish the year nearly as strong as he started it, losing August to plantar fasciitis and having a good-but-not-great September, Ruiz still finished with numbers that looked much closer to prime Ivan Rodriguez than they did to Carlos Ruiz. .325/.394/.540 with 121 hits, 16 home runs, 68 RBIs, 201 total bases, and a 149 OPS+, all of which, with the exception of his OBP, were career bests. The 149 OPS+ he put up was, among catchers with 400 plate appearances and 80 games caught in a season, the 30th highest in the modern era of the MLB. Of the twenty guys above him, eight are in the Hall of Fame, two more are well on their way, and in eight of those seasons, the guy who did it finished in the top-2 in MVP voting that year. One of those times was 2012, because this dude named Buster Posey went and had himself a monster season. Even led the NL in batting average when all was said and done, leaving Ruiz as an afterthought to many. What's more, Posey's Giants won the World Series for the second time in three years, while Ruiz's banged up Phillies squad just barely scraped their way to a .500 season. Sure hope this won't be a harbinger of the careers these two will have going forward.

With the kind of support a two-time World Champion squad can give you, Posey was given room to flourish in the next three seasons, winning two Silver Sluggers, garnering many MVP votes all three years, and attending two more All-Star games. Won another ring, too. What Ruiz came home to was a team that was a shadow of the greatness it had once approached. And that shadow only grew longer as the years went by. In 2013, Roy Halladay went down with an injury, and never pitched in the bigs again. In 2014, the same happened to Cliff Lee. Kyle Kendrick had been here the whole time, but had only ever been pretty good after his rookie season. Other guys who had shown promise like J.A. Happ, Vance Worley, and even a fresh face named Ken Giles, had been shipped off in trades. And while Hamels and Papelbon were still here and still doing great, by the end of 2015 they were both on islands when it came to quality pitching. The offense may have been even worse. Ryan Howard had turned from world-beater into an argument for worst contract in the sport, Chase Utley and Jimmy Rollins had turned from a substantial 1-2 punch in the lineup to just a pretty good tandem, and no matter how many past their prime players the Phillies threw at the problem, none of them worked. Michael Young, Delmon Young, Marlon Byrd, Grady Sizemore, even Jeff Francoeur got in on the action. Nothing helped. The Phillies went from 48-48 at the 2013 All-Star break to finishing the year 73-89. A rough 5-19 stretch immediately following the break meant Charlie Manuel lost his job to Ryne Sandberg. Didn't help much since the 2014 Phillies duplicated the 73-89 record. Then Sandberg lost his job to Pete Mackanin halfway through the next season, Philadelphia were 29-62 at the break, and finished the year 63-99, barely avoiding a hundred-loss season with a win in their final game of the year. Through all this, Carlos Ruiz had been giving this team everything he could. Even when you're in your mid-30s, if you're Carlos Ruiz, everything you've got ain't nothing. 2013 and 2014 turned out okay for him, as he averaged .259/.336/.369 between those two years while providing good enough catching to get by. Even won a Player of the Week award and caught a combined no-hitter in 2014. But then came 2015. And even when you're Carlos Ruiz, age comes for everyone. Both his batting numbers and his catching numbers fell off a cliff. Negative bWAR and even worse fWAR, lowest average, on-base, and slugging of his career, and having to say goodbye to Hamels, Utley, and Papelbon midseason. As a parting gift, Ruiz did help Hamels throw a no-hitter in his final start as a Phillie, which tied Chooch with Jason Varitek for the most no-hitters caught in a career. By the end of the year, the only people left from the championship team just seven years prior were Ruiz and Howard. Neither would see much playing time for the Phils in 2016, as Howard served mostly as a pinch-hitter, and Ruiz, who was 37 now, had ceded his starting catcher spot to Cameron Rupp by the second month of the season. As Philadelphia approached the end of a season that would finish 71-91, they figured they could still get something for their elderly catcher, and sent Ruiz to the LA Dodgers after the waiver trade deadline for two minors guys who never made the majors and a future One Left Off in A.J. Ellis. After 14 games in the regular season backing up Yasmani Grandal and a couple pinch-hitting appearances in the playoffs (one of which ended in a home run), he got sent to Seattle in a one-for-one for left-handed reliever Vidal Nuno III. In 53 games backing up regular starter Mike Zunino, Ruiz hit .216/.313/.352, which, while just about the best you can expect from a 38-year-old catcher, was a good sign it was time to hang em up. And so he did. His first journey into free agency that offseason would also be his last, as he has yet to suit up for a Major League club again. See ya Chooch.

I'm sure I could come up with several rational reasons for why Ruiz belongs off the ballot and Napoli doesn't. Statistically, it sure seems like the right call. But there's just some part of me that says Chooch is missing and he should be on there. This guy had no business carving out a career that could not only qualify for the Hall of Fame ballot but even, as crazy as it sounds, maybe get a vote or two. The great Phillies teams from 2007 to 2011 just wouldn't be complete without Carlos Ruiz at that C position. Oh, and you know how many no-hitters Mike Napoli has caught? Zero. Not a single one. But Carlos Ruiz has *four* of em, and you know what el- sorry, I should stop.

Chooch would visit the Hall of Fame in a Phillies cap for the little bit of stuff he did with em.

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 6-1 on the week and took 3 of 4 from the Dodgers in LA. I think this speaks for itself. |**90-46**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-0**| The Dodgers continue to be very good, sweeping the dbacks and then getting demolished by the Braves a little. Walker Buehler is coming back and we're all hoping he can be great because there is no other notable news related to the Dodgers pitching staff. None at all. |**84-52**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| The calendar rolls over to September and the Orioles happen to be in first place. First time since 2014 if memory serves. Watching the games, you would have to think the Most Valuable Oriole this year is Ryan O'Hearn. The guy just flat out rakes and can play more than one place in the field. Sure, Adley is great behind the plate and Gunnar is coming into his own, however for a guy that was basically given to the Orioles by Kansas City it sure has worked out in our favor. Also, good to see Jorge Lopez back in an Orioles uniform. Looked fine yesterday, 1 IP 1 H and 0 R. We will take it. It on to LA and then Boston this week, next week a showdown with the Rays, which will probably decide the division. |**85-51**
**4**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| We enter September with Randy etching himself into Rays history with the longest streak of 20/20 seasons at 3. Is it HOF tier, maybe not, but as a young franchise it's a nice achevement to have. Yandy is also back in the lineup after an injury scare which is nice. We'll need all hands on deck to challenge for the division as the O's have kept pace and the Rays have one of the highest SOS's to close it out. |**83-54**
**5**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+2**| apology for poor english where were you when mariner is sole first place? I was sat at home playing video game when discord ping 'mariner is win, texas is walk in winning run' ['yes'](https://streamable.com/spcu6) |**77-59**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-0**| It's funny that everyone's saying the Yankees swept the Astros. That's fake news; the *Asteroids* got swept. The Astros are doing fine... just fine... nothing to worry about here, not at all. No. |**77-61**
**7**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-2**| Going to start an Only Fans that just shows Rangers bullpen highlights because all they do is just blow saves game after game. |**76-60**
**8**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**| Milwaukee hasn't won a post season series since 2018. Now, I'm not saying I'm looking at booking a flight to MIlwaukee, but I'm definitely keeping my calendar somewhat open to book a last minute flight to maybe a NLDS.   The most not exciting acquistion the Brewers made at the deadline had a great week.  Mark Canha led the team with a .412/.500/.706 slash this week. |**76-60**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-1**| The Phillies lost 2 very winnable games this week and still ended up going 3-3. They gained position in the Wild Card despite the mediocre performance. There are currently 4 teams tied for the 3rd Wild Card spot, so it would absolutely be in their best interest to avoid that. The goal remains the top spot though, as the team is below .500 on the road. This week, 3 games in San Diego against the not technically eliminated Padres before playing the Marlins at CBP. |**75-61**
**10**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**| That damn injury bug hit like a biblical plague of locusts the past two weeks, sidelining Bichette, Chapman, Jansen, and Swanson, four absolutely key contributors during this crucial end-season run. Thankfully we kept the ship sort of afloat, winning two series vs WAS and COL. This is another big week for (hopefully) padding some Ws vs the only two teams already mathematically eliminated from the postseason in OAK and KC. All we really need to do is keep within firing distance of TEX, who we have a MASSIVE 4-gamer with the following week. If this team can't make the playoffs, some metaphorical heads will roll, starting with our Qanon-loving MAGA dipshit of a ""hitting strategist"" Dave Hudgens, who'd rather be retweeting to own the libs rather than help his lineup not underperform most of the season. Make this roster great again, Dave.  |**75-62**
**11**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**0**| The Cubs started the week with a series win against the Brewers, one highlighted by Justin Steele and Kyle Hendricks outdueling Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff respectively. While the Cubs followed that series up with a split in Cincinnati, it still felt like a letdown as Adbert Alzolay and Mark Leiter Jr, the two best Cub relievers, blew 1 run 9th inning leads. Nevertheless, the Cubs managed to put some distance between them and the other NL Wild Card contenders; they are 3 games up on the 3rd Wild Card spot with series against the Giants and D-backs coming up. |**73-64**
**12**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+2**| Another .500 week for the Twins, eternally forbidden from being more than 5 games above .500. The AL Central got more interestinger too as the Guardians won a series against Minnesota, to put them 5 games back with another series coming up this week and a chance to close the gap. The team absolutely looks like it can hold on for the rest of the season, the question is: will it? |**71-66**
**13**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-1**| It's over! We're out!! We went to Houston within striking distance, and we just totally blew it. Even when healthy the rotation isn't good enough. Despite the failure in the standings, there have been some standout performances. Ceddanne Rafaela and Wilyer Abreu have looked great in their limited time up, Duvall has gotten hot again, and Casas has really been solidifying himself as one of the best bats in the AL (7th in OPS). The future is bright, but the present is meh. |**71-66**
**14**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**|  |**70-67**
**15**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-2**| The Giants record is basically what we wanted at the start of the year, more or less, but because they tricked us into thinking they were better, the 2023 season is especially frustrating. The games are frustrating, the injuries are frustrating, the schedule is frustrating, and I'm willing to bet so are the inconsistent garlic fries. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch Giants games, but I won't blame anyone for picking up a new hobby. One silver lining -- they COULD still make the playoffs and no one on their 40-man roster has been arrested recently for being a garbage human being. |**70-67**
**16**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| Xavier Edwards and hampson better never leave the lineup for the duration of the season. that 4 game sweep of the nats has been huge for us and has certainly made the WC race. alot more interesting |**70-67**
**17**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**-1**| The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of winging it in the 7th inning because you forgot how to play in the first 6. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of filling your farm system with prospects and lucking out on enough to keep fan interest. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of buying tickets for the upper deck before realizing you have to climb 5 flights of stairs to get there so instead you just stand in the nearest tunnel getting in everybodys way. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of divorced single parents looking to ignore their problems for 3 hours. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of the midlife crisis, no not the kind where you go out and get way too invested in a hobby that realistically youre never going to keep, but instead the kind where you spend 4 days on your couch watching TCM because you started a Film blog and you think TCM only shows real art that modern Hollywood could never make today. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of standing just outside of the line at a fast food restaurant because you dont know what to order even though you spent the last 15 minutes driving there so why you didnt decide what to get is beyond me, like they only serve so many varieties of food and lets face it youre probably just gonna get the same thing you got the last 5 times, and now Im slowly walking towards the counter because Im not sure whether youre about to order so I inch past you because Im worried youre suddenly gonna make up your mind. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of walking halfway to the kitchen to cook dinner but then just giving up and ordering pizza again. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of telling your wife you may have syphilis. The Cincinnati Reds, the official team of making your fanbase sad because every year starts to feel the same with the same issues that sometimes are fixed but other times arent&&&Im tired boss, I just want some sleep.|**71-68**
**18**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+2**| Fuck log cabins, I want to terraform Mars with Jasson Dominguez. Sweeping the Astros wasnt on my September bingo card to say the least. The fact that it was fueled by prospects makes it even better. Even though the playoffs are likely out of reach, this teams giving the fans something worth watching for the first time since the end of June.  |**68-69**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-1**| Extra innings is a failed concept. Winning three in a row against the Giants was a bit dissapointing, as it severely hurts our chances in getting a decent pick this season. They'll have to climb a lot of teams to get there, but I'm still confident that the Pads can make it to the top six in the draft.   |**65-73**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-1**| Could it be: could the Guardians be turning things around?! They won BOTH their series this week! I doubt one good month can make up for five subpar to bad months, but it is good to see them doing better. The series with the Twins this week is pretty much going to determine whether they have any shot at the division. In other news, this is the first week I did NOT make the Athletics #30. |**66-71**
**21**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-2**| What's there to be said that hasn't already been? The latest failure: Getting under the luxury tax by waiving players we emptied the little left in the farm system for. This last decade of Angels baseball has greatly diminished my affinity for the sport. I just want the pain of it to end. There is no hope in this life and there is nothing but darkness awaiting us in death. Happy Monday.  |**64-73**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**0**| DJ Stewart for MVP |**63-74**
**23**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| While we didn't get Colt Keith or Justyn Henry Malloy's debuts when rosters expanded for September, we did get to see Andre Lipcius's callup. I guess we'll see if he can carve out a reserve utility role down the road- how exciting! Miggy's 4-5 game on Saturday was legit exciting, though, and he's determined to finish out the final September of his career on a strong note. 8 more hits would tie Beltre for 17th (3166) on the all time list, but Ripken's 3184 is probably out of reach. This week: 3 at NYY, 3 vs. CWS. |**63-74**
**24**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+2**| The Pirates had a pretty good swing through the Show-Me state, sweeping the hapless Royals and taking two out of three from the Cardinals (this will likely be the first year Pittsburgh finishes in front of St. Louis since 1997). The Bucs, once again, have nothing to play for except pride down the stretch. This has been a tough season since April ended, so it would be nice if the Pirates could keep this hot streak going and finish the year on a high note and give Bucco fans something to look forward to in 2024.  |**63-74**
**25**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Goal for the 2023 Nats: finish with a better record than the Padres and Mets. |**62-76**
**26**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-1**|  |**59-78**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| I don't want to talk about this team, so I won't. Um, what's new with me? I spent a weekend in Vegas doing our fantasy football draft and I got Covid from the trip. I gave it to the wife, so that's been a fun week. Nothing quite like working from home and sort of feeling up to work so you set yourself as available on slack and then people constantly message you with questions so you feel like you have to answer them, even through the pounding headache and constant coughing.  At least I have this fun long weekend to recover. It's not like I had any fun plans for Labor Day. (I did).  |**53-84**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The Rockies have never lost 100 games in a season, this will almost assuredly be the first.  They have to go 13-13 to avoid 100 losses, and only have one time this season of being at .500 or above over a 26-game stretch. |**50-86**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| This team is so bad that I, the r/baseball power rankings guy, crashed my car in front Kauffman on the way to a game. It'd be easy to say the game wasn't worth going to, but it was the Ned Yost induction game so I'm broken up about missing that tbh.  I had to wait 3-4 hours to get a tow because insurance companies are super cool and the cops (who did not show up at any point) are really helpful!!  If you don't like that you don't like Royals baseball!!!!!!  Cole Ragans '24 CYA. |**42-96**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| The A's swept the Angels this weekend, signifying there's a new Most Pathetic Team in the division (I type with a heavy dose of empathy). Gelof and Noda have like twice as much bwar as all the other hitters on the team combined, but Diaz/Butler are showing real signs of life. Please don't talk to me about the pitching (Blackburn was dealing on Saturday though that was cool) |**42-95**","baseball",31,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/16a3vsq/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_23_mariners/"

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|| A regular season for the ages. Tied the team record for most homeruns, .501 team slugging (which is a video game stat), a 40/70 season from Acuña, Olson had the most HR and RBIs ever by a Brave, and the list goes on. It feels like it World Series or bust now. If the 2023 Braves win the World Series, they very well could go down as best team ever. Even better news...we have most of these guys locked in for YEARS to come. Let's finish this thing.  |**104-58**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|| Honestly, at the beginning of the season if you told me we'd be missing May, Buehler, Lux, and Treinen for the whole year and that Urias would be off the team for a good part of the end of the season (Gonsolin too, but for different reasons), I would have to guess the Dodgers were wild cards wand the Padres were the division champions. I dont love dunking on the Padres that much but& wait yes I do. The point is that I expected the Dodgers to win like 85-90 games as they saved some salary for an Ohtani push in the offseason. In what was supposed to be a retooling year, whatever that means, with rookies being a larger part of the roster, if you said the Dodgers would win 100 games Id be ecstatic. The rookies blew my expectations out of the water and looked like they were having so much fun doing it. The thing is in the future this team should only get better. My expectations arent for us to win the World Series but to watch a good young team play some great baseball, grow, and have fun. And watch Kershaw pitch while we still can. |**100-62**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|| What an incredible season. Clinching the AL East for the first time since 2014 and getting a week off will be huge for this team. Can't go without mentioning the loss of Felix Bautista not only for the rest of this year but all of next year as well. The bullpen has a lot of good pitchers, none as good as him though. The ninth inning will look different throughout the playoffs, but Brandon Hyde has made it work so far, so we shall see how he implements the pitching staff. Baseball is a romantic sport and people always invoke the ""baseball gods"" when something happens. The loss of Brooks Robinson last week was crushing not only for the Orioles as an organization but for the city of Baltimore as a whole. I was actually on the field, as part of giving Austin Hays the ""Oriole Way"" award, when the news broke. The crowd became somber, and the mood changed. The thought of, do it for Brooks, seems apropos and hopefully the ""baseball gods"" will shine some light on Baltimore in the Postseason. We shall see. Either way it has been a hell of a season. |**101-61**
**4**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|| This (regular) season was arguably the most frustrating in recent memory for the Astros. It felt weird to not be incredibly dominant, but it was fun fighting for the division with the Rags and Ms - aside from dealing with the shenanifoolery from the bad apples in each of our fanbases. I'm not going to beat a dead former rabbit mascot over the major pain points of this season: Dusty, Maldy, injuries, lineups, Dusty, Maldy, injuries, lineups. What matters is that despite all the handwringing, infighting, and stress, we made it to October and anything can happen now. 11 more wins for a repeat title sounds nice to me. |**90-72**
**5**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|| What a wild and wacky season of Rays baseball 2023 was. The Rays entered the year in classic Rays fashion, with the only notable offseason move being their biggest FA signing ever in Zach Eflin, but otherwise small moves for a bunch of ""Who's That?""s and ""Maybe In The Future""s. Expectations were set on a playoff run, and if one or two guys broke out it could put us in serious contention. Another big thing was remaining healthy, because while it's fun to see a patchwork of previously perilous pitchers get punch outs, it's a lot less stressful to just have your studs. With KK's departure in the offseason this is the first fully 2020s-feeling Rays team, and they came out of the gates HOT. **CONTINUED IN THREAD** |**99-63**
**6**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|| After losing almost 200 games in the last 2 years and being 7 years out of the post season it does feel so good to be back. While the team lost the division on the last day of the season, it does feel good that they exceeded early season expectations and made it back to the post season as a wild card. Back in week 6 I said the offense and starting pitching were going to win a lot of games, and the bullpen was going to be blow a lot of games and boy was I right. The offense is going to have to carry this team if they make any kind of run, because the starting pitching has been hit hard with injuries and the bullpen, is well, the bullpen. Go Rangers. |**90-72**
**7**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|| After an eleven year postseason drought, the Phillies are in the playoffs for back to back seasons, this time clinching the top Wild Card spot. Between the Mets and the Braves, I think most Phillies fans didnt think a division title was possible, so this may have been close to the best case scenario. After starting the season 25-32, the team caught fire in the summer and finished with a record of 65-40 after June 2. 90 wins is a big deal for a team that barely snuck into the playoffs last season, and home field in the first round will likely be hugely important for a team that was barely over .500 on the road. **CONTINUED IN THREAD** |**90-72**
**8**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-21**| I think Milwaukee has the best chance they've had in a long time to make some noise in October.  No team is better than Milwaukee and preventing runs.  They've done it all season long with great arms and even better defense.  If Milwaukee can score three runs per game I think they're hoisting the trophy at the end of it.    Manager Craig Counsell will probably get snubbed (again) for the Manager of the Year award and isn't under contract for next year.  I'm curious to see what happens with him.  Everyone would love to see him back in Milwaukee again, but he might want to take time off and watch his son play at University of Minnesota.    Top hitter on the team this year has to be William Contreras, I still don't know how Milwaukee found a way to jump into that trade last year and probably get the best haul.    Top pitcher has to be Corbin Burnes.  Brandon Woodruff and Freddy Peralta have both been incredible in the last few months, but Burnes has a full season of success to look at.    This will be my last year doing the power rankings after what has to have been damn near a decade.  In the last couple months I've been using social media less and less and feel like it's the right time to get off the Power Rankings bus and hand the reigns for Milwaukee over to someone who's involved in the r/baseball community.  |**92-70**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|| This has to be one of the odder seasons I've had in my 35ish years of being a Blue Jays fan. On the one hand, you've got the following facts: Alek Manoah, the 3rd-highest CY vote getter from last season, absolutely fell off a cliff, ending the year not even on the roster as he battled terrible performance and his own hubris, going down to the development league in a desperate attempt to get his game back, never quite finding it; most of our star lineup (Vladdy, Springer, Kirk, Chapman, Varsho) had disappointing years at the plate, part of an offense that was average at best for nearly the whole season; they failed to reach 90 wins for what would have been the 3rd straight season; they were never really in the division race at all, between TB's megahot start and Baltimore's ascendancy; our baserunning likely cost us at least 5-6 wins; and our managers and coaching staff's decisions likely cost us another 5-6. If you'd told me all that, I'd assume we'd be a .500 team at best, and definitely not a playoff team. But then you have these facts: Our pitching staff, top to bottom, rotation to bullpen, was absolutely lights out all year long, despite a lost season from our biggest suspected contributor; Kevin Gausman finished the year with an AL-leading 237 Ks, one of the best marks in franchise history by a pitcher not chock-full of roids; Chris Bassitt pitched over 200 innings, and was a hero when we needed him with a fantastic pitch mix; Jose Berrios and Yusei Kikuchi turned in INCREDIBLE turnaround seasons after very down years in '22;**CONTINUED IN THREAD** |**89-73**
**10*|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-17**| The 2023 Twins really is a story of two halves. Before the All-Star break, the only thing going our way was the dominant pitching staff, the best in the majors by nearly every metric. Lacking run support, the team hovered at .500 through spring and early summer, just to come alive after the break. The bullpen came into its own, with the formerly shaky Emilio Pagan making strides and becoming a solid piece. Returning from injuries, Thielbar, Stewart, and Paddack have also contributed and turned the bullpen into a legitimate strength for us. The rookie callups all delivered as promised, giving the team possibly the greatest rookie class in franchise history from ***three*** key pieces in Julien, Wallner, and of course Lewis. And you don't have to look further than Max Kepler to get the story of the lineup. Hitting .207 at the break with a .688 OPS, Kepler delivered a .306 average and .926 OPS in the second half. This culminated in September being the team's best month, clinching the division and showing we're rested, ready, and firing on all cylinders for the postseason. The team you saw in May and June isn't the team that is heading into the postseason, and nothing needs to be said about our goal because everyone knows our history. The bottom line is that the Twins look competitive and are capable of beating anyone they play. |**87-75**

"2023-05-16",1684205519,"Giants bat around the Phillies in the bottom of the 2nd, scoring 6 on 6 hits and 1* error.","Yeah, we'll get to the asterisk. Inning starts out 2-0 Phillies. Bit late in putting this up, figured someone would've gotten to it before me.

- Schmitt: Singles up the middle, continuing the young kid's hot streak.

- Bart: Grounds the ball to third into what nearly becomes a double-play, but he's able to beat out the throw to 1st. 1 out.

- Johnson: Single back up the middle. 1st and 2nd, 1 out.

- Estrada: Grounds the ball to short, into what *should* be at least one out, but Stott just straight-up missed the ball at 2nd, everyone's safe. Bases loaded, 1 out.

- Flores: [Lines the ball to right, where Castellanos *also* misses the ball](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/1b692338-d0a1-4202-a674-2ca575893650.mp4). This is ***not*** an error, technically, because he manages to get the ball into 2nd to force out Estrada. Still, Bart scores on the play (YMMV on his chances against Castellanos' good arm if he catches that). 1st and 3rd, 2 outs, 2-1 Phillies.

- Conforto: [Decides to give the Phillies defense a break, and just knocks the ball over the left field fence for an opposite-field, 3-run homer](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/3df16869-82e4-485d-9505-05d7bc0e0bb7.mp4). 4-2 Giants, 2 outs.

- Davis: Doubles down the right field line, with Castellanos going for a barehand but missing it entirely, still managing to get the ball in before Davis can get past second.

- Haniger: [Singles to right, scoring Davis, and moving up to 2nd on the throw home that almost catches Davis](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/75d2ff60-97db-4e09-afa1-a18a1a826b7d.mp4). 5-2 Giants.

- Crawford: [Singles to left, easily scoring Haniger](https://bdata-producedclips.mlb.com/8b366442-4a87-44c0-8fcb-c5b6a5e1a0a1.mp4). 6-2 Giants.

- Schmitt: Gives the Phillies a break by grounding out to third, ending the inning.

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 5-3 in a week against teams we should have done a little but better against. We have to go fire out what's going gonna with our SP. Not making a move for one before the Trade Deadline seems glaring. Hopefully they can right the ship. It is not gonna work in the postseason. I almost put the Braves at 2 this week, I need to see some improvement if they wanna stay on top next week. |**75-42**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+3**| The madman Andrew Friedman has done it again. The scrappy Dodgers have been on fire, winning 12 of their last 13 games. The negative WAR trade pieces that no one else believed in have accumulated over 1.5 WAR since the deadline less than 2 weeks ago. If there wasn't one blow up inning against the padres the dodgers would be on a 13 game win streak as the NL west lead continues to grow. It's once again a beautiful time to be a Dodgers fan |**71-46**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Hmm I am trying to think, did anything interesting happen last week? No? Ok. I think I am just happy that everyone got to see what kind of ownership we really have. I honestly hope they do the right thing and sell the team when Peter Angelos dies. I don't wish ill will on anyone, however the sons don't want to own the team and it is pretty clear that John feels he is some sort of Aristocrat that is untouchable. Winning 2 out of 3 in Seattle was great. Cedric Mullins had the best two innings of a game I've seen in a long time. Kevin Brown has been freed. |**73-45**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-1**| A trip to the Bay area netted two series wins against the A's and Giants. No major injuries this week, in fact Jonah Heim miraculously returned to the lineup on Sunday which was way ahead schedule. The team is back home this week with series against the Angels and Brewers. |**70-48**
**5**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**-1**| I don't really want to make a comment, but that elephant sure is large. |**71-49**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| The Astros just can't really catch a break with injuries this year - not that injuries are the sole reason for Jose Abreu's general performance. However, this situation has taught us that Jon Singleton is the one true bat flip god. Great week for on-field performance by the Astros, though I have to say the Mets did their worst at welcoming me to Citi Field last weekend. |**68-51**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| An 11-4 outburst against the Cubs today saved what's been a pretty crap week. 2-2 split vs the Guardians and their neverending crop of Pitchers Who Might Be Dudes from the farm, followed by a 1-2 homestand with Chicago. Coming into today, the offense had only put up 13 runs in the 6 games prior. It's hard to overestimate just how important and consistently reliable this pitching staff has been, especially with Ryu back and looking like his old self. Our offense is 3rd in the MLB in batting average, but 14th in runs scored and 3rd-worst in runners in scoring position left on base. A day like today showed what can happen when everything is clicking at once; all we can hope is that it happens more often down the stretch. The 17-games-in-17-days slog is finally over, some big pieces are coming back from the IL this week and next, and we have a short week, with two vs the Cheesesteaks and three at the De La Cruzes. |**66-54**
**8**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+2**| The win streak has come to an end, with two close and frustrating losses against the best team in the AL to finish out a 3-2 short week. The Astros series in the back half of this week looms large, but does present an opportunity to tighten up the WC spots and make the last month and a half verrrrry interesting. Up next: 4 @ Cough, Man Stadium, 3 @ 60-Second Orange Juice Park |**63-54**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies won 3 of 4 agains the Nationals including a no-hitter and scored 13 runs against the Twins to start the weekend. Somehow fans are coming out of this week down on the team after they scored 1 run in the next two games against the Twins to close out their homestand. The bats need to be more consistent but that's been a problem all year. The team is still 1.5 games up in the first Wild Card spot and 3.5 games up on a playoff spot. The first Wild Card would be very ideal but as always it's just about getting into the Postseason. This week is a rest week with just 2 games in Toronto and 2 in Washington, and 1 in Williamsport against the Nationals. |**65-54**
**10**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**|  |**65-54**
**11**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-3**| The Giants have not been playing great baseball vs good teams. This is alarming because they only play good teams for the entire month. While I still see the spark within this team, its not quite as bright. The magic of our rookie call-ups has dimmed, someone integral gets hurt each week, and our bullpen and starting rotation have essentially merged to form an exhausted Voltron. But the Giants won a walk-off yesterday and hash tag momentum. Lets go to the numbers: 14th in MLB in Run Diff (-1 Spot), 18th in RS/G (=), 10th in RA/G (-1), 5th in Bullpen ERA (+1). Next up: 3 vs the quite-good Rays, although theyve scuffled a bit recently, and then 3 @ ATL who, like the Rays, are 5  5 in their last 10. Please hit, Giants. |**63-55**
**12**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-1**| The Cubs finally hit a bit of a cold stretch this week, ""only"" going 3-3 against the Mets and Blue Jays. The offense cooled off in New York, and Pete Alonso continued to torment Cub pitching. The series win in Toronto was a nice bounce back, and more importantly marked the last series against a good team until the end of the month. The Cubs will hope to have a similar hot streak to the one before the deadline to cement their place in a Wild Card spot and keep in touch of the NL Central leading Brewers. |**61-57**
**13**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+2**| Who needs deadline acquisitions, we've got *returning IL guys*!!! Sale, Story, Whitlock, Houck, that's like ~1 Ohtani Above Replacement or something. This is the best the roster has been all season, however the schedule down the stretch is *brutal*. Of our 44 remaining games, 28 are against HOU, LAD, TBR, BAL, TOR, or TEX, six of the seven best teams in the league (the only one we miss is ATL). If the Sox manage to sneak in, trust me, they'll have earned it. |**62-56**
**14**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-1**| A series loss to the Tigers, but winning a series against the Phillies? Look, at this point of the season all that matters is we hang on to our AL Central lead, then cross our fingers we get hot in October and win at least one game. |**62-58**
**15**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+4**| Marlins have been on a roll since Eury Perez came back up, coincidence???? all bs aside, he hasnt been as good as he was before he got sent back down but he should bounce back. In other pitching news, sandy is indeed back. Dudes pitched two complete games in his last 4 starts and he hasnt given up more than 4 runs going back to june 21st. Bell and Burger keep swinging the bat well, thank god for that. Kim Ng is a beast at the deadline. that is all. Got the trashcan bois visiting in miami to start the week then we head out to chavez ravine for 3 games. |**62-57**
**16**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| List of hardest things Ive ever had to do: 1. Sign the divorce papers my wife served me, 2. Drop my child off at school for the very first time, 3. Say goodbye to my brother as he died in hospice from cancer, 4. Moving away from my parents, 5. Interviewing for my first serious job, 6. Beating Godrick despite being woefully underleveled because I didnt grind enough, 7. Sitting in the waiting room while my wife delivered our son (I faint at the sight of blood), 8. Holding in my pee during the 3 hours of Avengers Endgame in theaters, 9. Sell my dads truck after he passed away, 10. Watch the Reds play baseball. Its just suffering at this point, and I want it to end. |**62-58**

**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**-2**| I'm looking forwards to the upcoming series against the O's, because my dad's from Baltimore, they've always been my second favorite team, favorite AL team. It's not the same, but I've been enjoying their squad. Other than that, I'm really looking forward to HSK bobblehead night, since I have tickets. As for your 2023 Padres, they came off of one of their highest highs in franchise history. They added Bogaerts, they've had nearly a whole season of Tatis. They didn't have it in May. They don't have it in August.  |**56-62**
**20**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| The Angels have a 1.5% chance of making the playoffs according to FanGraphs. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this team. If Shoehei knew what was good for himself, he'd shut himself down for the remainder of the season. |**59-60**
**21**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians went 3-4 this week and blew several leads late in games. I think they're basically done for the year. This week I'm going to Cincinnati and I'm probably going to see them take two Ls there. They're also playing the Tigers this week. I'm not even optimistic about that after how they did about the White Sox. |**57-62**

**23**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+1**| Matz and Contreras performing, Waino definitely not. Baker recalled from Memphis, Carlson on short IL. Seeing who's called up is the only thing left to look out for. Fire Mo. |**52-66**
**24**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-1**| The Jets dominated the Panthers 27-0 on Saturday. The Jets pass rush terrorized Bryce Young even with several of their standouts getting the day off.  Zach Wilson didn't have any ""wow"" moments, but he showed a lot of improvement in the bread-and-butter parts of being an NFL QB. Israel Abanikanda had a sick spin move and the Jets RB room is proving that they may not need Dalvin Cook after all. The Jets host Todd Bowles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next Saturday night. |**53-65**

**26**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| Here's my petition to leave Javy Baez on bereavement leave for the rest of the year (actually, the rest of his contract). I can't do it anymore. This week offers another opportunity to throw more wrenches into the AL Central ""race"" with two games at Minnesota and four at Cleveland. Someone has to win this slapdick division, right? |**53-65**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| This team sucks on ice. I managed to get to only my second game of the year this week, despite having a 12 pack of vouchers to games, simply because I do not want to watch this team or give them my money via parking and concessions. On the plus side, I got to see the White Sox pummel the Yankees and I remembered that baseball games (in general) are very fun. I just wish White Sox management seemed to care whether we win or not. |**47-72**

As a fun little game, were going to count the number of Jayson Werth injuries as we go. Ready? OK!

Jayson Richard Gowan Werth had baseball in his blood. His great-grandfather was a minor league shortstop who got as high as A ball in the New York-Penn league in the 1930s before injuries both cut his career short, and put the Greek chorus following Jaysons life on notice that they would be needed.

Grandpa Ducky Schofield would have more luck, parlaying his talent into a 19 year MLB career. A hitter of dubious ability, Ducky had his most productive years in an eight year stretch with Pittsburgh, where he was a member of their 1960 Championship team. But every time he seemed to be catching on, the injury gremlin would bite him in the ankle or the wrist and derail everything.

It doesnt stop there though, as Duckys boy, Dick Schofield would go on to have a pretty decent 14 year career of his own, winning the 1993 World Series with the Blue Jays: a World Series he was on the roster for but did not play in, after missing most of the 93 season with a broken arm.

(one more fun fact about Dick: he holds the MLB record for most seasons with 400+ at bats and less than 100 hits, a feat he accomplished four times)

After divorcing Jaysons father while Jayson was a small child, she married Dennis Werth, a first baseman who got into 117 games across four seasons with the Yankees and Royals from 1979-1982. And it was from Dennisnot his grandfather or uncle or athlete biological fatherwhere Jayson Werth picked up his love for the sport.

Games of catch with the elder Werth in the backyard evolved into catching lessons and blocking drills with a pitching machine. By the time Jayson made it to high school he was a legit prospect, batting .652 in his senior season.

The Orioles made him the first of their two first round picks in the 1997 draft right out of high school, and Werth decommitted from Georgia to sign in Baltimore instead. He began his big league chase as an 18 year old, slashing .295/.432/.398 in 32 Rookie League games, despite missing 20 games with recurring back spasms (**1**).

Hed spend the next two seasons playing at three different levels, performing well at all of them, then missing the 1999 Fall League due to a broken wrist (**2**). Playing catcher at all levels of his progress, Werth was publicly dismissive of suggestions that he would move to the outfield at some point in the minors, but a 2001 trade to the Blue Jays organization changed that.

With Darren Fletcher doing the catching for the 01 season and Josh Phelps and Kevin Cash seemingly ready to make the jump at AAA, the Jays didnt need another catcher and wanted to see if a transition to the outfield would help save Werth from injuries and prolong his career.

But they would have to wait to find out, as a foot injury would cost him almost 20 games. (**3**)

After a successful season at AAA in 2002, Werth made his big league debut that September, picking up a single off David Wells for his first hit. His cup of coffee at the end of the 02 season made his transition to outfield complete, as Werth acquitted himself admirably at all three positions and showed himself to be a competent, valuable fielder.

A wrist injury (**4**) would slow his start in 03, and he would spend most of the season bouncing between the big club and AAA as health and need required. The performance of rookie Reed Johnson made Werth a luxury piece for Toronto and the team decided they could use some different pieces of the puzzle going into the 04 season, flipping Werth to Los Angeles for Jason Frasor, who would go on to give the Jays nine seasons of 119 ERA+ work out of their bullpen.

The Dodgers would get considerably less out of Werth from the outset, as he would strain an oblique (**5**) in his second game of the season, missing two months before finishing the season slashing .262/.338/.486 in 89 games.

The 2005-06 seasons would probably be the low point in Werths career. AJ Burnett broke Werths wrist with a HBP in spring training (**6**), he rejoined the club in May, then went down in August with knee bursitis (**7**). He underwent a couple offseason surgeries, was still in pain heading into spring training 06, and was finally diagnosed with another ligament tear in his wrist (**8**). He went back under the knife in August of 06 without having played a single game, and setting up a savage burn from Manager Grady Little when a reporter asked him for an update on Werths status that August, to which Little responded Who?

But that lost 2006 season would also be a turning point for Jayson Werth, in a number of ways. The Dodgers, done paying for his medical bills, let him walk into free agency at seasons end. Finally recovered from his surgeries and litany of wrist issues, Werth was confident that he would still be a useful, everyday big league ball player. After a little hunting and a long, comprehensive physical, the Phillies agreed and signed him to an incentive-laden, one year deal.

Beginning the year as a bench player, Werth would find himself back on the DL with a wrist injury in July (**9**). But this one was a fluke; something Werth and the Phillies were confident wouldnt be a harbinger of anything to come. Werth was back with the club in August, quickly became an everyday outfielder, and went on a tear. From August 2 through the end of the season, Werth slashed .329/.438/.512 with five homers and a team leading 39 RBI. Finallyafter years of pain and stops and starts and more painJayson Werth had arrived.

He was a late bloomer, but one thing that all the time off did for Werth was keep a lot of early miles off his tires. That meant that once he finally *did* hit his stride, we was able to sustain it to an age beyond the point where most players start slowing down.

As a result, Werths prime years came in his age 29-35 seasons; a point nearly unheard of in professional sports, but a period of time where Werth produced a .281/.375/.480 slash with 153 HR, 504 RBI, 557 runs scored, 196 doubles and a 129 OPS+. Hed go to his only All-Star game in this period, pick up every MVP vote he was ever going to get, and be good for 23.7 bWAR.

It started slowly: Werth began the 2008 in a platoon with Geoff Jenkins, but his bat kept coming on stronger and stronger until he was playing full time by September. The result was then-career highs in games, hits, homers, RBI, runs, and OPS+. He would carry that hot bat through most of the postseason as well, including torching Tamba Bay for a .444/.583/.778 slash in the World Series, helping the Phillies claim their first championship in nearly three decades.

Werth would parlay that performance into a two year deal worth $10 million, solidifying himself as an everyday fixture in Phillys outfield. Hed blast 63 home runs and drive in 184 over the next two years, including 36 and 99 during a 2009 season where hed produce his highest single season bWAR total of 5.1.

After two strong years of playcompletely devoid of injuryWerth was in line for a decent little raise on his next contract. He had no idea.

The Washington Nationals needed flexibility in their outfield, wanted to add a little speed and, given the uncertainty of Adam Dunns contract negotiations, were also shopping for a power bat. When Dunn signed with the White Sox on December 3rd, the Nats figured theyd try and meet all three needs at once, and give Werth a seven year, 126 million dollar deal. Everybody agreed that Werth had produced admirably during his time in Philadelphia. But when the Nats suddenly made him one of the 15 highest paid players in MLB history, more than a few eyebrows were raised. Was Jayson Werth the kind of guy you built a team around? Washington was apparently willing to find out.

The relationship didnt start off well. Werth stumbled out of the gate, the Nats were under .500 after 50 games, the boo birds were making themselves heard, and a DC-area bar was offering discounted beers, with the price matching Werths weak batting average. Though he would pick up in the second half and finish the year with 20 homers, that would be coupled with a .232/.330/.389 slash and 98 OPS+.

People were saying that the Nats overpaid. They were saying that Werth had crumpled under the expectations of a huge contract. Some were openly wondering how long the Nats could keep up the experiment before cutting their losses. Werth came back next season ready to prove all the doubters wrong, but narrative continuity reared its ugly head once more, and Werth broke his wrist on a slide in early May (**10**).

Hed come back in August and finish the season having played in half of Washingtons games, producing a 124 OPS+ and 1.6 bWAR when he was there, but the narrative was set: Werth was a bust.

But if theres one thing that all the breaks and sprains and pain and recovery had taught Werth, it was how to keep swinging the bat regardless of outside opinion. Werth knew how to fight. And in 2013-14, despite all the mounting toll of injuries on his body, Werth seemingly *willed* himself to two last, excellent seasons.

Over those two years, Werth would miss time to a right hammy (**11**), a groin injury (**12**), flu-like symptoms (**13**) and surgery to remove necrotic bone from his shoulder (**14**). But he would still make his way into 276 games in those seasons, and slash .304/.396/.491 with 41 homers, 164 RBI and 169 runs scored. He produced a 143 OPS+ and 8.8 bWAR over that span and gave the Nationals and their fans every single ounce of himself along the way.

But he would go 1-17 in the 2014 NLDS, be supplanted in right field by Bryce Harper to begin the 2015 season, and once again break his wrist that May (**15**). This time, instead of bouncing back like it always had, Werths body fell apart like the Bluesmobile after making it to the City Assessors office. Though he would get into 143 games in 2016, Werth was never again even a league average hitter, turning in OPS+ marks of 85, 97 and 83 over his last three years.

Entering free agency once again after the 2017 season, Werth found no takers for a 38 year old charity case, and eventually accepted a minor league deal from the Mariners. He hit .206 in 36 games at AAA Tacoma before suffering another, final, hamstring injury (**16**).

Enjoying his time at home with his family during rehab and not wanting to further jeopardize his health and post-career lifestyle, Werth hung up his spikes that July and went home. Speaking of homes, he sold his 15,000 square foot Virginia mansion in 2021 for 5.7 million and now works an organic farm in Illinois.

Jayson Werth played 15 seasons in MLB, with almost exactly half his games coming in a Nationals uniform. He won a ring with the Phillies, but hes in the Nationals Ring of Honor and he goes into the Hypothetical Hall in a Nats jersey. He ranks 10th in Nats history in runs scored (450).

"2023-04-14",1681437441,"Comparing the Rays streak to other hot starts.","The 2023 baseball season is underway, and the storylines are beginning to emerge. Adley Rutschman is a beast, Shohei Ohtani is a god, the best pitchers live in Minnesota, infants will carry Arizona to the promised land, Detroit's spirit animal is the Ford Pinto, and the Mets are still the Mets. However, by far the biggest story of the young season is that the Tampa Bay Rays, known for their low payroll and even lower attendance, have started the season 13-0. This hot streak has tied the record for longest winning streak to start a season since 1900, and the Rays aim to break the record tomorrow night in Toronto. However, the streak is not without controversy, as some fans and media pundits (Christopher Russo) have dismissed Tampa's wins as good fortune from the scheduling gods, seeing as their opponents during this time were made up of players that would be out of place in the Double-A minors. This got me thinking, ""Well, if the Rays streak should be written with a ~~Houston~~ asterisk, what was the quality of the opponents of the previous record holders? Did they face only 'real teams' or were they mashing against beer leaguers?"" So I set out to find out just that. These are my findings. 

Also, if it wasn't obvious, I am a Rays fan. Yes, my parents know, and they are accepting of my lifestyle choices. I will do my best to keep personal bias out of the results, but if I slip up, please call me out on it. 

As of the time of this writing,  the Rays are 13-0. They have won 3 games vs Detroit, 3 games vs Washington, 3 games vs Oakland, and 4 games vs Boston. I obviously don't have the results of the 2023 season, so I will use the results of 2022 while for other teams I will use the results of that year.

Detroit finished 2022 66-96, 4th in the AL Central. 

Washington finished 2022 55-107, 5th in the NL East.

Oakland finished 2022 60-102, 5th in the AL West.

Boston finished 78-84, 5th in the AL East. 

In total, these teams finished 259-389, with a winning percentage of .399.

With these statistics, we will compare the quality of opponents of the Rays with that of other historical teams. In this experiment, this is our control. 

The 1987 Milwaukee Brewers started the year 13-0. They won 3 games vs Boston, 6 games vs Texas, 3 games vs Baltimore, and 1 game vs Chicago. Chicago broke the streak. Milwaukee would go on to finish 1987 91-71, 3rd in the AL East. They did not make the playoffs. 

Boston finished 1987 78-84, 5th in the AL East.

Texas finished 1987 75-87, 6th in the AL West.

Baltimore finished 1987 67-95, 6th in the AL East.

Chicago finished 1987 77-85, 5th in the AL West.

In total, these teams finished 297-351, with a winning percentage of .458. 

The 1982 Atlanta Braves started the year 13-0. They won 2 games vs San Diego, 6 games vs Houston, and 5 games vs Cincinnati. Cincinnati broke the streak. Atlanta would go on to finish 89-73, 1st in the NL West. They made the playoffs and lost the NLCS to St. Louis. 

San Diego finished 1982 81-81, 4th in the NL West.

Houston finished 1982 77-85, 5th in the NL West. 

Cincinnati finished 1982 61-101, 6th in the NL West. 

In total, these teams finished 219-267, with a winning percentage of 0.451. 

In 1981, the Oakland Athletics started the year 11-0. They won 4 games vs Minnesota, 4 games vs California, and 3 games vs Seattle. Seattle broke the streak. Oakland would go on to finish 64-45, 1st in the AL West. They made the playoffs and lost the ALCS to New York. 

Minnesota finished 1981 41-68-1, 7th in the AL West.

California finished 1981 51-59, 5th in the AL West. 

Seattle finished 1981 44-65-1, 6th in the AL West. 

In total, these teams finished 136-192-2, with a winning percentage of .415.

Authors note: The records for 1981 may be off due to a players strike taking out a chunk of the year. To be safe, I'm going off of what Baseball Reference says. 

In 1966, the Cleveland Indians started the year 10-0. They won 1 game vs Washington, 4 games vs Boston, 2 games vs New York, 2 games vs Kansas City, and 1 game vs California. Chicago broke the streak. Cleveland would go on to finish 81-81, 5th in the American League. They did not make the playoffs. 

Washington finished 1966 71-88, 8th in the AL.

Boston finished 1966 72-90, 9th in the AL.

New York finished 1966 70-89-1, 10th in the AL.

Kansas City finished 1966 74-86, 7th in the AL. 

California finished 1966 80-82, 6th in the AL. 

In total, these teams finished 367-435-1 with a winning percentage of .458. 

In 1962, the Pittsburg Pirates started the year 10-0. They won 3 games vs Philadelphia, 5 games vs New York, and 2 games vs Chicago. New York broke the streak. Pittsburg would go on to finish 93-68, 4th in the National League. They did not make the playoffs. 

Philadelphia finished 1962 81-80, 7th in the NL.

New York finished 1962 40-120-1, 10th in the NL. 

Chicago finished 1962 59-103, 9th in the NL.

In total, these teams finished 180-303-1, with a winning percentage of .372.

In 1955, the Brooklyn Dodgers started the year 10-0. They won 4 games vs Pittsburg, 2 games vs New York, and 4 games vs Philadelphia. New York broke the streak. Brooklyn would go on finish 98-55-1, 1st in the National League. They won the World Series against New York. 

Pittsburg finished 1955 60-94, 8th in the NL.

New York finished 1955 80-74, 3rd in the NL. 

Philadelphia finished 1955 77-77, 4th in the NL. 

In total, these teams finished 217-245, with a winning percentage of .470. 

The grand total of the opponents (minus those against the Rays) is a record of 1,416-1,793-4, with a winning percentage of .441. 

The grand total of the streakers is a record of 516-393-1, with a winning percentage of .567. 3 out of 6 teams made the playoffs, with 1 World Series championship.

So what can we learn from this outside of good teams tend to beat bad teams? What does this mean for the Rays? Personally, I don't really have an answer. Realistically, Tampa Bay could be anywhere between a .500 team and World Series favorites. Are winning streaks really created by the schedule and which teams are imploding, or is there something deeper in the numbers?

I'm going to pull a cop out and let you decide in the comments. I look forward to being the Franz Ferdinand of the war that's about to take place. However, there is one thing I think we can all agree on: Boston is trash lmao.","baseball",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12lfkc9/comparing_the_rays_streak_to_other_hot_starts/"

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| The bad news? We went 3-3 against teams that we should've been at LEAST 4-2 against this week. The good news? We are still 6 games up on the Dodgers for the best record in the NL and 3 up on Baltimore for the best record in MLB. The better news? WE CLINCHED A PLAYOFF BERTH. The EVEN BETTER NEWS? The Braves could clinch the division by Wednesday. Oh...and Acuna is on pace for 40-70. Olson could hit the most HRs in a season EVER by a Brave. Still some fun stuff to play for. |**93-49**
**2**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+1**| A 7-2 road trip honestly is nothing to complain about, so I won't. Still have a 3-game lead with a huge series upcoming this week with the Rays. John Means comes back this week from TJ surgery and will start on Tuesday. No guess to what the corresponding move will be or what the rotation will look like moving forward. Either way super happy to be in this position this late in the year. |**90-52**
**3**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| The boys in Blue have cooled down and are down to using mostly rookies in the pitching staff. They potentially could clinch a playoff spot this week so look for that. I'm excited for the Mariners series as I can finally see my second Dodger game in person this year. Regardless our expectations for the team are not as high as they have been in years past but they still are fun and exciting to watch and we can't wait for playoffs |**87-55**
**4**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| The Rays managed to take a series against west-coast nemesis Seattle and Zach Eflin gave us lovely descriptions of himself on the mound, so overall it was a pretty good week. Speaking of Zach Eflin, he's closing out a very nice year (4.2 fWAR currently) proving that sometimes big FA contracts can work for the Rays. Looking forward, this week may decide the division as the Rays have a final 4-game series at Camden Yards. Prayers up that everyone can stay healthy to close the season! |**88-56**
**5**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**+1**| In a week where we regained first place, a player tripled twice in one inning, and we swept the Rags, all anyone can talk about is banana pudding. Yet, we just seem to be talking about banana pudding, not eating it. Something seems wrong there. |**82-62**
**6**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+4**| Solid week that included taking a series from OAK and sweeping KC pushed the Jays back into possession of the WC2. The offense, despite losing a lot of key contributors over the last week or two, provided some much-needed sparks, led in part by a handful of young guys called up from Buffalo (Schneider, Clement, and Horwitz), as well as some long-awaited recent runs of success by struggling stars (Vladdy, Kirk, Biggio, and Varsho). This week is HUGE, as we look to be mostly healthy coming into a 4-game series vs Texas with the chance to really knock the reeling Rangers out of the playoff race. Someone play ""Trap Queen"" and play the Joey Bats bat toss on a loop, because we need to get the 2015 vibes rolling again.  |**80-63**
**7**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-2**| Not the most ideal road trip - a number of bullpen implosions turned a potentially positive trip into a 3-7 one. The lack of off days and amount of travel in this trip finally caught up and unfortunately did so at a terrible time, so the cushion the M's once had in playoff positioning is all but gone. The last 10 games vs. the Texas teams will almost certainly still end up being the decider for the final AL West positioning, but it'd be nice to get some leeway between now and then. Up next: 3 vs. Pretend Los Angeles team, 3 vs. Real Los Angeles team |**79-64**
**8**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**0**| If the playoffs started today, Milwaukee would be playing Arizona.  That's a series matchup that pitching fans should dream of.  Saw this absolute gem of a stat talking about Freddy Peralta, ""Two starts into the second half, Peraltas ERA was 4.72 and Milwaukee was under .500 when he started. In eight starts since, the ERAs 2.09 with a FIP below 2.00 and a strikeout rate in excess of 40 percent. ""   |**79-63**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| Another frustrating week of being a Phillies fan, losing two 1 run games that were absolutely winnable. The Phillies are very lucky that there aren't really any red hot teams behind them in the wild card, as they've been assuredly mediocre the past 2 weeks. It's not the start to September anyone was looking for, but as long as they can manage that first Wild Card spot, they should be in good shape. Last year's team more limped to a playoff berth than clinching one, so a poor September isn't necessarily a dooming moment. |**78-64**
**10**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+1**| It was a tale of two series for the Cubs, as they swept the Giants before losing 3 of 4 to the D-Backs. The offense's struggles finally bit the team, as they wasted excellent outings from Justin Steele and Jameson Taillon. Justin Steele in particular was outstanding this week, throwing 15 innings and allowing only 1 run with a career high 12 Ks vs the Giants. His excellence means he is now one of the frontrunners for the NL Cy Young. The Cubs this week have series against the Rockies and Diamondbacks and will welcome the services of top prospect Pete Crow-Armstrong, who has kist beem called up. |**77-67**
**11**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-4**| It's all about perspective, if you would have told me at the beginning of the season the Rangers would be fighting for a wild card spot this late in the year I would have been estactic. If you would have also told me it's because they've completely blown a division lead I would have believed you too. |**78-64**
**12**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**0**| September is the best time for things to start clicking. Two convincing series wins this week, including one against Cleveland to likely cement an AL Central title. Our Magic Number is down to 12, and if the team keeps rolling like this we may even win a postseason game this year. |**75-68**
**13**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The D-backs had a great week, taking three of four vs. the Cubs in the Snakes' most important series of the year so far. The starting pitching has been great and the bullpen is finally not an abject disaster. Rookie top prospect Jordan Lawlar debuted and made some flashy defensive plays, but experienced offensive woes as he adjusts to big league pitching.  |**75-69**
**14**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+2**| Tanner Scott has a massive pair of balls. I dont know what the fish are gonna do now that Sandy is on the IL but that seriously throws a wrench in our playoff hopes. Hopefully, we get plenty of run protection from our lineup, which is gonna be a tall order with Soler out. As long as bell and burger keep hittin dingers we should be ok. We got 4 games in Milwaukee and then were hosting the Braves at home later in the week |**74-69**
**15**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-2**| Can we just wrap up the season already? Aside from getting to see Ceddanne get his first taste of the big leagues, there's really not much left to watch for. Hell, we got beat 11-2 by the Orioles and it wasn't even the most embarassing loss of the series. Let's just get to the offseason so we can all pretend that the Sox are definitely signing Yamamoto |**73-70**
**16**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-1**| The Giants have won 3 in a row and are 1.5 GB of the wild card. They are now relatively healthy or soon will be.15th in MLB in Run Diff, 14th in RA , 21st in  RS / G, and 12th in Bullpen ERA. Up next is 3 vs the Guardians  and 4 in Coors Field. Winnable games that need to be won if there's hope left. |**73-70**
**17**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**| I sat in the field of flowers, all had ceased. I was asked why I had not moved, for I had been on the ground for weeks. I could not move, and I did not want to. The feeling had fled from my body, my ducts had run out of tears. My son hugged me closely, how I loved him. I could not move, I could not live. The Reds had been good, and for that I was happy. A smile formed on my face, my son raised the barrel. I looked at my photo of Joey Votto and pulled it close, I told my son I was ready, and he pulled the trigger. The Reds had been good, and that was happiness.  |**74-71**
**18**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**0**|  |**71-72**
**19**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**0**| It's nice to have Profar back. Maybe trade for Myers back. Maybe....uh, no, not Pham. There's one game between the Mets, with the 6th worst record, and the Pads, with the 11th worst record. Currently, our draft pic would be 21, if I'm understanding correctly. Gotta reach 6th. Unfortunatley, that makes it hard to watch right now. I can't root for them not to beat the doyers, and it's perhaps unrealistic to ask for the A's to sweep San Diego this weekend. |**67-77**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| Last week I wrote about how I thought the Guardians were turning a corner. I think they blew that with their 2-5 week this week. I went to a game where they lost 20-5. It was the worst game I've been to and the guy sitting near me said he's been a fan for 65 years and it was also the worst he'd been to. |**68-76**
**21**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**0**| While it is worth taking the rumors about the Angels being open to trading Mike Trout with a grain of salt given the source, the question remains, would they actually say no if he asked for one? I tend to think they would honor his wishes if push came to shove. More than that, he is reaching a point in his career where it largely makes sense to ask for one, even given his understated personality. He's afforded the team all the time in the world to try and build a contending core around him and they've failed miserably. There is no reason to believe that they will stumble into one soon.  |**67-77**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**0**| J-E-T-S Jets Jets Jets |**65-77**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+1**| Not a bad week for the Bucs, who went 3-3 against the first place Brewers and Braves. The Pirates took 2 of 3 against Milwaukee despite facing the team's three best pitchers, and they would have won the series in Cobb County if the bullpen hadn't melted down. All of this while having a rotation of two starters, one of whom (Mitch Keller) got shelled in his lone start this week. It was the offense who led the way, powered by a .370/.414/.593 week from Bryan Reynolds. It hasn't been the best season for the Bucs' outfielder, but he should finish the season with an OPS over .800.  |**66-77**
**24**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-1**| I might have been real down on Spencer Torkelson in the first half, but the positive signs in his underlying metrics have been turning into realized production in the second half. Even though the average is still low, the barrel rates and exit velos have been strong and the slug has been high (currently 3 bombs shy of 30). This week: 3 vs. CIN, 3 at LAA |**66-77**
**25**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**+1**| A surprisingly good week for St. Louis, taking 2/3 twice, first against the Braves, then against the Reds. "" "" |**63-80**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Here I am begging the Lerners to sell the team. I love them and what they did for the city but please pass the torch to someone else. |**64-79**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| I know no one reads this or cares about the White Sox at this point (and I don't blame you) so let's talk about what I've been reading. I joined a discord reading group and right now we're reading Tress of the Emerald Sea. It's one of Sanderson's new books this year and I'm enjoying it a lot. It has a great Cozy Fantasy vibe. I also finished ""This Is How You Lose the Time War."" It's a short one so I listened to it on audiobook and also read it in print. It's full of beautiful prose that reads like poetry. It's easily my favorite thing that I've read this year. |**55-88**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| We're at that point in the season where I don't care anymore.  Easily the worst season in Rockies history. |**51-91**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Last week I wrecked my car on the way to a game. This week I drafted Kelce. ""Is it football season already?"" everyone in KC collectively groaned every day since March 30.  ""Can Ragans play WR?"" everyone in KC collectively groaned as Kadarius Toney replaced his hands with hula hoops. Bad luck does not fully explain this team's futility, but what other team has destroyed a light in the Monster? What other team's ace fell off the mound twice within two minutes? If you don't like that, you don't like Royals baseball. |**44-100**

#**#20 - Rafael Devers - Boston Red Sox [](/BOS) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** u/lars9

I was higher than consensus with Devers, ranking him 13th. He's one of the most consistent hitters in baseball. You can pretty much write in ink he'll hit around .285 with 30 HRs and 40 doubles. OBP will be north of .350. Since 2019, he's 15th amongst hitters in fWAR. The dude just hits the ball hard, ranking in the top 7% of Exit Velocity in each of the last 4 years, topping out in the top 2% last year. Alongside his bat, his defense is adequate, I don't see any Gold Gloves in his future, but he's fine at the hot corner. Devers may not be flashy or on a path to 40 HRs, but his consistency is what makes him incredibly valuable.

#**#19 - J.T. Realmuto - Philadelphia Phillies [](/PHI) - Catcher**

**Written by:** u/Pjd7510

In 2022 JT Realmuto would become the first catcher since Ivan Rodriguez to post a season of 20 Home Runs and 20 Stolen Bases. Add on some incredible playoff heroics which included an inside the park home run against the Braves in the NLDS and a game winning home run in extra innings against the Astros, JT would further cement himself as the best catcher in baseball. His offensive ability, combined with his framing ability and cannon of an arm that makes base runners think twice about stealing on him, helped bring him his second career Gold Glove Award and third career Silver Slugger Award.

#**#18 - Kyle Tucker - Houston Astros [](/HOU) - Right-Fielder**

**Written by:** u/youdontknowhimnow

Kyle Tucker was the 10th best prospect in all of baseball according to Fangraphs' 2019 Report. Eric Longenhagen wrote a small little paragraph about him, saying how he was divisive (Ted Williams comps) and how he's probably a right fielder who had a good bat, which was correct. Longenhagen then said that ""on the low end he projects somewhere in the Max Kepler/Nomar Mazara area"", which was very wrong. Kyle Tucker is a star right fielder, and he's slept on because he plays for the Astros.

So let's say you're Kyle Tucker, right. You're not, you're not Kyle Tucker, stop dreaming. Anyways, if you're Kyle Tucker, and you've just made the majors with your above average power (45.1% Hard Hit%) and your average contact ability (86.3% Z-Contact%). And you're sucking. You're hitting .141 in 28 games, and this is 2018. The Astros are just one year removed from a World Series victory, and you're looking in from Round Rock.

What do you do?

I know, let's change your swing. Tucker's swing went from average steepness to Mike Trout level steepness. His swing went from a league average VBA to a top quartile VBA (VBA is basically the angle of your bat), and his contact quality became excellent. He was able to harness the good power that he had to create a good batting line.

Okay, that's great. What else do you do?

I know, let's turn your league average crappy defense in right field to that of a gold glover. His DRS went from -1 to 14 from 2018 to 2022. And, you know, while you're at it, win a Gold Glove and an All-Star nod. Arbitrary, fan-voted recognitions and awards are great, so just rack those up.

And suddenly, you're really good! You have a .275/.344/.516 line in the past two seasons with a 137 WRC+! Congratulations! You win! Hopefully Longenhagen won't compare you to Nomar Mazara again.

#**#17 - Jacob deGrom - Texas Rangers [](/TEX) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/throbbingkitty

Action/Shooter Video games, Tesla, and Major League Baseball. What do these things have in common? They all feature flamethrowers. As the MLB average velocity of fastballs has risen precipitously over time, Jacob deGrom is one of the hardest throwing pitchers in baseball today. But before we get into the present, lets discuss the humble beginnings. deGrom was selected by the Mets in the 2010 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft. This draft was particularly memorable as it featured one of baseballs most hyped prospects ever, Bryce Harper. Outside of Harper, this draft was remarkably stacked with talented players who would go on to have successful careers in the bigs including guys like Manny Machado, Christian Yelich, Yasmani Grandal, Nick Castellanos, and a bevy of future Mets pitchers including Noah Syndergaard and the Mets 1st round selection, Matt Harvey. So where did the current $185 million dollar man fall in this draft? Top 5? Top 10? 1st round? No, unfortunately Jacob would have to wait a few rounds before he heard his name calledspecifically, the 9th round, where deGrom was picked behind Whit Merrifield, Brandon Crumpton, and Aaron Barrett.

How does a young man prove the draft reports that resulted in his late-round draft status were spurious and distasteful? Simple; throw the ball harder. Out of high school and even into his first couple years in the bigs, deGroms fastball sat in the low 90s with the occasional visit to 96 mph. But as is well documented, deGroms velocity has increased each year from [2014 to 2022](https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/05/degrom-dominance-mets), averaging 99.3 mph in 2022 at age 34. If they say that Father Time is undefeated when it comes to claiming careers, Jacob appears to have some daddy issues. That being said, we all know it aint just about speed [(just ask Steve Dalkowski)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dalkowski). Since winning RoY in 2014, deGrom has been able to miss bats to the tune of a 2.52 ERA during his nine years in the bigs (2.62 career FIP for all the ERA haters out there). A historic season in 2018 set the new benchmark to be considered dominating, as the current $37m AAV bag holder led the league in ERA (1.70), FIP (1.98), ERA+ (218), and HR9 (0.4) on his way to winning his first of two Cy Young awards (unbelievably, his 269 Ks were 2nd to Max Scherzers 300 that year). Since then, although its been nothing short of impressive, it has come with its share of injury concerns. After averaging 184 IPs from 2014-2019 and 12 starts in the COVID-shortened season, deGrom has battled a myriad of injuries the past two years that has hampered his ability to pitch into the season, averaging 13 games and 78 IPs in 2021 and 2022. Despite the inevitable questions that may surround how well his body will hold up in Texas over the next 5 years, outperforming expectations should be considered the norm for deGrom.

#**#16 - Corbin Burnes - Milwaukee Brewers [](/MIL) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/e_schlanzz


Expectations were soaring for Corbin Burnes coming off of a breakout, Cy Young winning 2021 season.  While on paper this season didnt quite match up to the dominance of the prior campaign, Burnes still proved hes an elite starter and strikeout machine.  Pitching for the first time in his career over 200 innings, Burnes cemented himself as the ace of aces in a quality Brewers pitching staff.  He boasted a 2.94 ERA and sub-1 WHIP for the second season in a row.

Burnes brilliance comes from his reliance on his cutter. It is his primary fastballthrown 55% of the time in 2022but it has one of the sharpest horizontal movements in the league. Off of this 95 MPH pitch, he is able to effectively tunnel a curveball, changeup, slider, and sinker/two-seamer in an arsenal that moves both directions. [This thread of overlays](https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja/status/1518722894452375552) shows just how vile this pitch mix can be to a hitter. This dizzying display of sequencing, spin, and control leaves opposing batters mystified and swinging for air.

Talk surrounding Burnes promises to get uniquely interesting as he, at only 28 years of age, has two years of team control remaining.  Milwaukee fans are ever hopeful, but the organization remains unlikely to sign anyone long-term unless the deal is team friendly. The chance to acquire a new ace in his prime might create one of the most captivating trade or free agency conversations in recent memory.

#**15 - Carlos Correa - Minnesota Twins [](/MIN) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/0000zero00000

After a record-setting offseason in which he agreed to a combined $865 million and 31 years of contracts in free agency, Minnesota got a late Correamas gift at a clearance discount with the unexpected return of their franchise shortstop. Despite a history of injuries and controversies rich enough that this sentence didnt even make you think of the time he broke a rib getting a massage until now, Correa has consistently performed at an elite offensive and defensive level when healthy, putting up nearly 40 rWAR through his age-28 season despite only playing 5.48 seasons worth of games. While you can debate the merits of including intangibles in this sort of ranking (and theres no evidence that anybody did), its at least worth noting that Correas leadership qualities have consistently resonated beyond his years. Whether its leading an ascendant Astros team to the franchises first World Series as a 23-year-old or somehow arguing as a 26-year old that the Astros were victims after receiving no meaningful consequences for orchestrating the most egregious cheating scandal in the past 100 years of baseball, Carlos is the type of competitor you love to see in the dugout, no matter its your own teams dugout or that of your hated rival.

#**#14 - Sandy Alcantara - Miami Marlins [](/MIA) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/corygm

Ask anyone in the Marlins front office, and theyll say that Sandy Alcantaras Cy Young-winning 2022 season was not surprising in the least. They have long since been high on him, first evidenced by stealing him away from the Cardinals (along with fellow top-100 lister Zac Gallen) for Marcell Ozuna, and then by inking him to a 5-year deal last winter that could keep him in Miami through 2027. On the mound, Alcantara is the definition of workhorse, having eclipsed the league in IP (228.2 - next highest: 205) and Complete Games (6 - next highest: 3) in 2022. But he isnt just an innings eater - armed with a fastball that regularly touches 100mph, and devastating changeup, he can more than hold his own in rate stats amongst baseballs top pitchers, as shown by him appearing near the top of the leaderboards in stats like FIP (2.99), WHIP (0.98), and BB% (5.6%). In the clubhouse, hes viewed much the same way; together, Alcantara and de facto team captain Miguel Rojas have brought stability and life to a young, unproven Marlins team that looks to build on the positive storylines of 2022 and do big damage in 2023.

#**#13 - Francisco Lindor - New York Mets [](/NYM) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/futhatsy

After an outstanding six years in Cleveland where he cemented himself as one of the best young talents in the sport, Francisco Lindor was the focal point in a blockbuster deal which brought him to Queens, New York in the 2020-2021 offseason. Prior to taking an official at bat as a New York Met, Francisco signed a massive 10 year, $341 million extension, ensuring he won't only be on the team, but will represent the face of the franchise for the ensuing decade. So when he was only good in his first year as a Met with a 103 wRC+ and 4.2 fWAR, it left many fans disappointed and uneasy. He wasn't traded for and extended to be good, he was traded for and extended to be a star. In 2022, that star arrived with one of the best seasons of Francisco's career and a top 10 MVP finish.

From a skills perspective, Lindor falls under the category of ""greater than the sum of his parts,"" there isn't really one tool that wows you. What makes him great is that he does everything well, and he does it every day at a premium position. He doesn't have elite power, but it's still good enough to hit 26 home runs last year. He doesn't have batting champion-level contact skills, but he still keeps his K% reliably under 20%. He doesn't steal a ton of bases, but he picks his spots, swiping 16 last year. His arm is not particularly strong, but he gets such good reads that it rarely matters, as evidenced by his very solid 13 outs above average last year. So, if you're willing to take a leisurely stroll down Cherry-Picked-Stat Lane with me for a minute here, do you know who else in baseball other than Lindor hit at least 25 homers, struck out under 20% of the time, stole at least 15 bags, and had at least 10 outs above average last season? No one. Not since Pablo Sandoval's belt burst have we seen a player so well rounded.

#**#12 - Julio Rodriguez - Seattle Mariners [](/SEA) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** u/federalleaguemvp

Signed out of the Dominican in 2017 by Seattle, J-Rod was already a flashy top-25 prospect in the winter of 2021. The future face of the franchise and a potential face of the league, it was very odd to discover a former president of team openly mocking his english speaking skills. Which were... kind of incredible for a teenager from a spanish-speaking country!? Rodriguez buried this embarrassing element with a unique combination of charm and talent. He won the rookie of the year award, carried the Mariners into a playoff spot, and slashed 284/.345/.509 with a 146 wRC+. His OAA placed him in the 95th percentile, he was elite at putting the barrel to the ball and wound up with 98th percentile sprint speed.

Overall, it was a bold and strong entrance into the league. Especially for a guy who signed a $400M mega-extension, that could be one of the largest deals ever. He does have patience issues, with concerning K &amp; BB rates, but there is time to fix this. Since he's still only 22!

#**#11 - Freddie Freeman - Los Angeles Dodgers [](/LAD) - First Baseman**

**Written by:** u/thefuckinwolves

I think I have to be honest here: I hated this signing. I looked back at what Max Muncy had become, how well Justin Turner was aging, and thought there was simply no space and no need for Freeman. How wrong I was. Freddie almost instantly felt like a career Dodger (RESPECTFULLY, I ABSOLUTELY KNOW HE'LL RIGHTFULLY BE REMEMBERED AS A BRAVE), as he fit in both the lineup and clubhouse perfectly. This was particularly poignant in the first half of the season, as while Max Muncy looked like my cat at the plate, Freeman stepped into the two hole and refused to stop raking for the entirety of the season. There is nothing missing from Freddie's offensive game, which fits flawlessly with the Dodgers' general approach: Try your best to not strike out much, walk a lot, and hit for power. While some may balk at the lattermost claim as he hit 10 fewer home runs in 2022 than 2021, he made up for it with an additional 22 doubles. If you have any vague idea of how math functions, you may have noticed that Freddie did something pretty unique in 2022. Freeman looked at the dead ball being put in place, laughed quietly, and proceeded to put up the best full season wRC+ of his career by a distinct margin. While he did continue his theme of having brutally graded defense, Fangraphs can get fucked.","baseball",36,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10lbclj/rbaseball_top_100_players_for_the_2023_season_2011/"
"2022-12-14",1671033428,"John Anderson, the man whose 1903 baserunning blunder was so famous that for decades after, sportswriters would call a misadventure on the bases a ""John Anderson""","Happy birthday to [John Anderson](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/98/60/72/98607272736b8950340df20eae83297a--highlanders-new-york-yankees.jpg)! Anderson could be remembered for being the first, and to date best, Norwegian to play major league baseball... he could be remembered for being traded for himself, sort of... or he could be remembered for leading the New York Highlanders in RBIs during their first pennant run in 1904. 

Instead he's remembered for a baserunning blunder he made in a game on September 24, 1903! 

[John Joseph Anderson](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/anderjo01.shtml) was born December 14, 1873, in Sarpsborg, Norway. As a child, his family emigrated to Worcester, Massachusetts, and soon he took up baseball. As a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher he caught the eye of the local team playing in the New England League. Anderson was fast but wild -- in one game, he walked 13 batters and hit three more -- and was moved to the outfield. In 1894, he was hitting .354, good enough for the Brooklyn Grooms (as the Dodgers were then known) to sign the 20-year-old switch hitter to finish out the season. Within a few years, he'd established himself as one of the better hitters in the National League, and in 1898 he led the league in triples (22) and slugging percentage (.494) while posting a 140 OPS+.

In 1903, Anderson was the starting first baseman for the St. Louis Browns. Entering the September 24 game that would change his life, Anderson was in the midst of a hot streak: over the last seven games, he had hit .344 (11 for 32), with seven runs scored and seven runs batted in. But no stolen bases! After stealing six bases in May and seven in June, he had just one in July, none in August, and just two so far in September. This being the Deadball Era, stolen bases were a big part of the game, and indeed, three years later Anderson would tie for the league lead in stolen bases with 39. (Caught stealing data isn't available, so we don't know what his success rate was.) He stole 338 bases in his 14-year career, but had set a career low the previous year with just 15, and this year he had but one more than that.

So perhaps Anderson was feeling a bit squirrely that September 24, the first game of a doubleheader against the newborn New York Highlanders. The Highlanders staked pitcher Happy Jack Chesbro to a comfortable 6-0 lead fueled by a three-hit day from Wee Willie Keeler. 

But the Browns had something cooking in the top of the 8th, with two men in, two men on, and one man out. Anderson then got on base -- a walk according to some sources, reached on an error according to others -- to load the bases and bring up future Hall of Famer [Bobby Wallace](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wallabo01.shtml). 

Wallace worked the count full, and then swung and missed at the 3-2 pitch. Highlander catcher Monte Beville fired to first baseman John Ganzel, surprising Anderson, who was halfway to second. With that base occupied, he had no choice but to try to scramble back to first, but Ganzel easily tagged him out to end the inning. A strike 'em out throw 'em out double play!

For the next 50 years, the story was told and retold as Anderson being a man so dumb he tried to steal second base with the bases loaded. (But in reality, Anderson had simply taken too big a lead, and the catcher had picked him off with a surprise throw to first base.) In some versions, he slides into second, only to look up and see his perplexed teammate standing there looking down at him. Sportswriters, well into the 1940s, would say that a player had ""pulled a John Anderson"" without any other context, and readers would know it was a baserunning mistake. There's even a ""John Anderson"" entry in *The Dickson Baseball Dictionary*:   

&gt; **John Anderson play:** The particular boner committed when a runner attempts to steal an occupied base. The term is named for the outfielder/first baseman who, while playing for the St. Louis Browns against the New York Highlanders on Sept. 24, 1903, supposedly tried to steal second base with the bases loaded, and was thrown out. However, press accounts (e.g. New York Sun, Sept. 25; Peter Morris) indicate that Anderson, having taken an aggressive lead, was picked off by the catcher throwing the ball to first base. In the end, Anderson's nonattempted steal became his most famous play.

Still... getting picked off first base with the bases loaded was pretty dumb, and an ignominious way to end the rally. The Browns would go on to lose, 6-2. 

After his baserunning snafu, there was no future for Anderson in St. Louis. But he was wanted... by the Highlanders! Browns manager Jimmy McAleer was asked by Highlanders manager Clark Griffith what he wanted for Anderson, and McAleer replied: ""Give me an old bat bag or anything and take the big stiff."" Honest John was exchanged not for a bat bag but Jack O'Connor, a 37-year-old backup catcher who coincidentally had a 37 OPS+ in 212 at-bats. As for Davis, he'd play a few years in the minors before popping up again in the bigs with the Cincinnati Reds in 1907, hitting .229/.293/.297 (82 OPS+).

New York saw Anderson as a replacement for the recently released Lefty Davis, who had been the Highlanders' starting left fielder and leadoff hitter in 1903. The Highlanders had signed Davis from the Pirates, where he had hit an impressive .313/.415/.421 (139 OPS+) in 1901 and .280/.377/.336 (118 OPS+) in 1902. But he'd broken his leg during the 1902 season, and with the Highlanders in 1903 he'd fallen off to just .237/.319/.263 (73 OPS+) and apparently didn't make up for it with his glove. Sportswriters speculated the 28-year-old Davis had never fully recovered from that broken leg, and at the end of the season, the Highlanders released him. (Davis, by the way, had the first plate appearance in Highlanders history, if that ever comes up on a trivia night. He grounded out.) 

Anderson was quite an improvement: He hit .278/.313/.385 (116 OPS+) in 558 at-bats, with 27 doubles, 12 triples, and 20 stolen bases, and he led the team with 82 RBIs. He would play in 143 of the Highlanders' 155 games in 1904, typically playing center field and hitting in the middle of the lineup. 

In the biggest game to that point in New York's young history -- the infamous [wild pitch game](https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/october-10-1904-jack-chesbro-uncorks-a-wild-one/) that the soon-to-be Yankees lost to the soon-to-be Red Sox, 3-2, to decide the American League pennant -- Anderson had a single and threw out a runner at the plate. And in those critical final eight games of the season, Honest John was red hot, hitting .448/.500/.586 in 32 plate appearances!  

He opened the 1905 season primed to continue as New York's starting center fielder and batting fifth, but he got off to a horrible start, hitting just .200 (10 for 50) over the first 13 games of the season. The Highlanders benched him for a couple weeks, and that seemed to help, as he'd go 13-for-36 over his next 10 games, but after an 0-for-7 found himself back on the bench, his overall numbers .232/.296/.283 (76 OPS+) in 99 at-bats. 
The Highlanders, too, were struggling and by the end of May were in last place at 14-22. Maybe looking to shake things up a bit, they put the 31-year-old Anderson on waivers and he was claimed by the Washington Senators, where he'd enjoy a resurgence, hitting .281/.323/.356 (119 OPS+) in 1,316 ABs across three seasons, and lead the league with 39 stolen bases in 1906. The White Sox would pick him up in 1908, and he'd hit .262/.321/.315 (109 OPS+) in 355 ABs. He'd stick in the minors for a few seasons after that, then become a policeman and a farmer. He died in 1949 at the age of 75.

Anderson Addendum: 

* Anderson had three nicknames: Big John or Long John, because at 6'2"" he was one of the tallest men in turn-of-the-century baseball; the Swedish Apollo, even though he was actually born in Norway, because of his handsome face and muscular build; and Honest John, because he rarely argued with umpires, and only when he was sure they were wrong. (It was said Honest John was so honest that on the rare occasion he protested an umpire's call, the umpire doubted himself!) 

* Maybe he wouldn't have objected to being called the Swedish Apollo: His mother was Swedish, he married a woman who had been born in Sweden, and he was buried in Worcester's [Old Swedish Cemetery](https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/91761/old-swedish-cemetery). 

* Anderson was involved in a most unusual transaction in 1898. He started the season with the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, but in May was traded to the Washington Senators for future considerations. With Washington, he hit .305/.357/.516 (149 OPS+) with 28 doubles, 18 triples, and 9 home runs in 430 ABs, and Brooklyn's team president -- a guy named [Charles Ebbets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ebbets) -- claimed Anderson had only been ""loaned"" to Washington, and now they wanted him back. After much wrangling, Anderson was returned to Brooklyn to close out the season. Apparently the player to be named later... was himself. 

* Honest John had another brush with a name you know when [Connie Mack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Mack) -- then managing the minor league Milwaukee Brewers -- bought Anderson's contract from Brooklyn for an undisclosed sum prior to the 1900 season. Anderson hit .310 for the Brewers in 542 at-bats, good enough to convince Ebbets to once again try to get Anderson back. He claimed him in the Rule 5 draft -- yes, the Rule 5 draft is that old, dating back to 1892, allowing major league teams to claim minor league players. But Milwaukee and the other teams of the American League had declared themselves a second major league to rival the National League, and would no longer allow its players to be taken in the Rule 5 draft. So Anderson stayed in Milwaukee, and hit .330/.360/.476 (135 OPS+) with 90 runs, 99 RBIs, and 35 stolen bases -- I hope you had him in your 1901 rotisserie league! The following year Milwaukee relocated to St. Louis, which is how Anderson became a member of the Browns. 

* Big John's 82 RBIs in 1904 tied the Highlanders' team record, set in the inaugural season by second baseman Jimmy Williams. It would stand as the franchise's highwater mark until 1911, when third baseman Roy Hartzell drove in 91... and *that* record would stand until 1916, when Wally Pipp knocked in 93. No Yankee would drive in more than 100 runs until Babe Ruth knocked in 135 in 1920. Andersons 82 RBIs in 1904 stood as the franchise record for a switch hitter until Mickey Mantle knocked in 87 in 1952. 

* Anderson had two other odd records to his credit. He was the first player to lead the majors in slugging percentage without hitting at least .300, which he did in 1898 (.294 BA, .494 SLG); and his 46 doubles with the Browns in 1901 were the American League record by a switch hitter until Baltimore's Brian Roberts hit 50 in 2004. Oh, and the Browns became the Orioles in 1954, so doubles by a switch-hitter is something of a franchise tradition.   
  
* Anderson's final major league at-bat was a notable one: He was sent to pinch hit with two outs in the 9th inning of a perfect game. On [October 2, 1908](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE190810020.shtml), Chicago's Ed Walsh was facing Cleveland's Addie Joss. Walsh struck out 15 batters and allowed one run on four hits and a walk, but Joss was even better, retiring the first 26 men he faced. The last hope was Anderson, sent to pinch hit for Walsh. Anderson hit a line drive down the left-field line that landed just foul! He then hit a hard grounder that third baseman Bill Bradley fielded behind the bag and threw across the diamond, but low. First baseman George Stovall scooped it as Anderson crossed the bag, a bang-bang play. The umpire called him out, and Anderson  the man called Honest John because he so rarely argued calls  turned to protest. But already fans were streaming onto the field to celebrate the second perfect game in American League history.
  
* ""Pulling a John Anderson"" may be retired as baseball slang for a baserunning blunder, but it still pops up from time to time among political pundits for a longshot third party candidacy. In 1980, Republican congressman [John Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Anderson) ran for president as an independent against Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Anderson, a moderate Republican, won 6.6 percent of the popular vote but no electoral votes. After that, he served on the board of directors of FairVote, an organization advocating for election reform in the United States, including an instant run-off system that would make third party candidates more viable. This isn't the same John Anderson.  

* An actor named [John Anderson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026930/) played Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in both *Eight Men Out* (1988) and *The Babe* (1991). This isn't him either! 

* And let's not forget Jon Anderson, who is the lead singer of Yes. Here's [Owner of a Lonely Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVOuYquXuuc). 

Over a 14-year career, this John Anderson hit a respectable .290/.329/.405 (114 OPS+) with 328 doubles, 124 triples, 50 home runs, and 338 stolen bases, good for 28.8 bWAR, and deserves to be remembered for more than just one baserunning mistake.","baseball",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/zlum25/john_anderson_the_man_whose_1903_baserunning/"

3.	Boromir DH
4.	Gimli C
5.	Gandalf 1B
6.	Sam RF
7.	Merry LF
8.	Pippin 2B
9.	Frodo CF

Obviously a team that is just made of the fellowship would have pretty good chemistry but this team fucking sucks. Super top heavy. The tigers scored 3.44 runs per game with 110 home runs and the bottom four in their order would absolutely smoke these hobbits. Merry and Pippin would never pass a drug test either 

1 Legolas SS. 

The best possible team would probably just be 9 elves but thats boring af. Legolas would hit .400 with platinum glove level defense for 500 years

 2 Aragorn 3B. 

With superb stamina and balls of titanium, Aragorn would make a pretty solid pitcher but the defense at third would be too good to pass up. As a long sword expert, he could also easily slash .320/.410/.630 and would be a leader in the clubhouse. Plus hes super hot

3 Galadriel RF.

Im basing this on sexy badass Galadriel from the Rings of Power. Similar to Legolas, excellent contact skills and clutch performance. Easily a .300 hitter for at least 1000 years

4 Tom Bombadil LF.

Could be the best baseball player of all time but could just as easily be a total bust. Has the potential to post 10+ WAR but Im really not sure hed want to participate in the league or even understand the rules of the game

5 Treebeard DH.

Definitely got a big strike zone and far from elite bat speed but if he makes contact I have no doubt hes cranking 800 foot moonshots. Despite being slow as fuck and made of wood, the 30ft stride lengths help him get down the line. Not much of a team player though. If he had to sub in on defense hes a home run robbing machine with poor mobility and an absolute cannon of an arm. Hed hit .178 with 84 home runs


6 Gimli C.

Alejandro Kirk has exemplified the ideal catcher physique for the last two years. At approximately 46 220 lbs, Gimli fits the mold perfectly. Hes got 40 home run pop plus dangerous speed (over short distances) that allows him to be a 40-40 threat. Tiny strike zone plus a good eye makes him a .400 obp guy too

7 Boromir 1B. 

Just a solid all around player. Probably a .245/.360/.490 guy with average defense. Fights through injuries like a champ and is hell bent on acquiring rings

8 Gollum CF. 

Trying to keep this team composed of entirely protagonistic characters and gollum isnt truly evil anyway. His best comp is probably miles straw. Hes not hitting for power in his warped yet primal physical form. Elite speed and defense in the outfield with tenacious attitude and nearly indestructible body. Much like Boromir, focused on rings. .230/.315./.330

9 Samwise Gamgee 2B.

Jose altuve has shown that halflings can thrive at second base. Sam gets the nod here based on pure testicular fortitude. With the season on the line in the ninth inning Id put Sam in to pinch hit for 2004 Barry Bonds 

UTIL: Faramir

Offensively hes a lot like Boromir but worse. Slightly quicker with the glove

Starting Pitcher: Gandalf

Based on Mario Super Sluggers (2008), in which magikoopa is nearly unhittable with a filthy change up, wizards are naturally excellent pitchers. Gandalf is a good leader and is super reliable 

Relievers:

Setup man: Bilbo Baggins

Toadsworth is a tiny old guy and is even more unhittable than magikoopa, but lacks stamina

Closer: Eomer

Baseball and Pokemon: two intellectual properties forever united by balls, and the desire to catch 'em all.



As we waited for the World Series to commence, I curated a list of 50 names of Pokemon-who-sound-like-baseball-players and baseball-players-who-sound-like-Pokemon, and made the following game for you to challenge yourself in distinguishing one from the other:

"2022-11-08",1667922567,"HOF Odds Part II - Players 30-32 (Late Mid-Career)","**Mid-Career Players (Were Age 30-32 this season)** 

\*Machado, Harper, Betts, Rameriez and Nola were 29 in 2022 (among others) and for max character count will have to be included on a list of players 27-29 which will def be the final list because players younger are too young to really evaluate

Link to Part 1 (Players 33 and older) - [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/yezqi2/hof\_odds\_detailed\_list\_for\_older\_players\_pre\_2014/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/yezqi2/hof_odds_detailed_list_for_older_players_pre_2014/)

**Hard Locks -** 

**Mike Trout -** Included in the last list but should not forget how young he is. Could be the greatest of all time if he stays healthy but locked up a 1st ballot induction when he played his 10th season and satisfied minimum requirements. A historic player

**Soft-Locks - Would have to have a truly historic decline not to get in** 

**Nolan Arenado -** After Arenados probable MVP-2 season in 2022 I would move Arenado into the category of a soft-lock. Everything suggests that Arenado will end up in the hall of fame. There is always the possibility that player goes full Andruw Jones or has a career-ending injury but without a dramatic underperformance of the aging curve Arenado should get in. 

On the defensive side of the equation Arenados reputation as an all-time great at 3B is more or less secured. Since 2013 hes lead pretty much every defensive statistic at the position. His traditional case is even more impressive with 10 gold gloves in ten seasons. There only 17 players who have won 10 gold glove awards, 14 of whom are/certainly will be in the HOF. While Arenados defensive peak is likely slightly behind him with his great performance in 2022 its likely he will only add to his case going forward

Unlike many other defensive greats, Arenado also has something of a bat. A career 124 OPS+ hitter, Arenado has led the league in HRs three times and RBIs twice. At only the age 31 hes already accumulated 299 HRs and is a strong contender to reach 400. While maybe not dominant enough of a hitter if Arenado was relying on his bat alone for a person playing a premium defensive position very well these numbers are excellent. Perhaps the only real threat to Arenados HOF bid was that he built his career around hitting in a way that worked at Coors and might struggle when moved. His good but not great 2021 season added some weight to this suspicion especially with Arenados offensive drop-off in 2020 while still in Colorado. However after having undoubtedly the best season of his career posting a 154 OPS+ in 2022 he has proven himself able to hit well outside of Coors and added enough good hitting seasons and all-start seasons to form the solid foundation of his case. All of this adds up to nearly 52 WAR at 31 putting him easily in range of finishing with over 65. 

Could things still go wrong? Certainly Arenado couldnt retire tommorow and walk into the HOF. Arenado has 6 clear HOF caliber seasons and two pretty good ones. Thats a decent HOF core if he plays a long time,  one or two more all-star caliber season would greatly add to Arenados case and put his core beyond a reasonable doubt. Arenados only real problem though is accumulation. At 5831 PA hell need to play at 5831 PA at least 4-5 more relatively complete seasons to reach basic counting stat milestones. Either of those those things would likely be sufficient to make Arenado at least a 10th ballot HOFer, if he does both hell likely get in 1st. Coming off the best season of his career still in his early 30s its very likely hell accomplish that. Arenados statcast does hint at some regression but likely to a 120-130 OPS+ hitter at first but is still good enough all around that he should remain very competitive and perhaps even dominant for the next few years. 

**Freddie Freeman -** Freemans case has a remarkable lack of problems. Unlike Goldschmidt he was able to debuted fairly early getting his first full year in at 21. This means that at 32 he already has 7000 PA, 1826 hits and 47.2 WAR putting him well on pace without a serious decline to blow Goldschmidt out of the water in most counting stats except for maybe WAR. Freeman while maybe not the best player in baseball has a strong enough reputation including an MVP award and 6 All Star appearances to not have too much problem on peak. Hes had another exceptional season in 2022 so theres little reason to worry about Freemans ability to continue chugging along. Freeman who is a guy whose traditionally hit for average is also going to outperform his WAR with traditional voters so he has a boost there. The narrative is also coming together. Freeman was the heart and soul of Atlanta Baseball for a decade and is now thriving on a big market team. Freeman is not a guy likely to be looked over. Even if he declines a little too rapidly his role in bring Atlanta a WS in 2021 plus his strong base of support there will likely give his candidacy a boost in the VC. 

Its not a perfect case though. Freeman at 49 WAR, a 140 OPS+, and 292 HRs is not the highest of peak candidates. Hes probably on track for 400 HRs not 500 and maybe 65-70 WAR not 80. These are very good numbers but they arent numbers that are insurance against a rapid decline as has happened to players like John Olerud. Although they do give Freeman some room to miss a season or so due to injuries. Freeman will have to continue to be good for another 2 or 3 years and then coast by a little longer to completely lock down the HOF. Having a very good statcast page and playing the best he ever has theres really no reason to expect he wont 

**On the Right Path - Things could go wrong for them but if they age normally they should get in** 

**Aaron Judge -** Aaron Judge has just come off one of the best seasons ever. Despite his disappointing play off performance he now holds the clean HR record, put up better offensive numbers than anyone since Bonds and added 10.6 WAR to his case. Regardless of what happens next Aaron Judge has written himself into the annals of baseball history. A single historic season does not a hall of famer make but Judge has shown this isnt a fluke. Judge had another great season in 2017 where he put up 8 WAR and finished second in MVP voting and framed these seasons with slightly injury shortened but still solid 5 WAR seasons in 2018 an 2019. Only 2020 could really be described as a missed season before another near top of the league although not quite historic 6 WAR season in 2021. The basic question in Judges case is will Judge be great enough to overcome his probable deficit in accumulation. Judges 2022 season significantly helped him at that regard cementing his reputation as one of the generations greatest hitters, moving him from solidly behind to only very slightly behind where he needed to be in WAR, and creating a strong narrative case for Judge. It would not take too many 2022 to make Judge a HOFer. Still Judge has significant problems when it comes to traditional stat accumulation, his late start and missed time to injuries have led Judge to not yet put up 1000 hits or 250 HRs entering his age 30 season. While his very strong performance in 2022 helped significantly Judge is still far behind. For that reason I cant really consider Judge a soft-lock  if Judge has 2 more 7 WAR+ really really good seasons, a long with a couple of decent ones the accumulation wont really matter. He will be elected as a kind of Sandy Koufax hitter. Thats a tall order for any player but one  Judge is up to as clearly one of the most talented hitters to ever play. Judges statcast page is video-game numbers. His biggest weakness his K% is likely to significantly improve with an auto-ump as the very tall Judge has historically been a victim of poor called strikes. Theres every reason to expect that Judge is going to continue to be an exceptional hitter capable of incredible things and Im very bullish on him making the hall. Still until he puts up one more mvp-contender season I dont see him as a soft-lock because greatness is not something that can be expected and Judge doesnt have a ton of room for error. 

**Jose Altuve -** People may not like Altuve but his HOF credentials are pretty solid for a guy who just completed is age 32 season. Altuves case starts with his 46.5 WAR at age 32. Giving him a bit of credit for an abbreviated 2020 thats on track for 60. His reputation as the best 2B of this generation is at this point is pretty much unshakable. Cano might have been about better than Altuve but for clean players its not close. He has tons of hardware 8 all star games by 32, 5 silver sluggers, and 1 MVP. More so  hes the type of player of traditional voters will like having 3 batting tiles and having led the league in hits 4 times. While Altuves case is mostly about his bat at a premium 2B rather than his fielding he isnt Derek Jeter either. Since OAA have been tracked since 2016 hes put up a positive 8 runs prevented. While undeserving of his one gold glove hes not a defensive liability. Looking through comparisons there isnt any one player that really fits Altuves profile so its hard to give him an exact historical analog. I think the best comparison is probably the old HOFer Billy Hermann. 

Altuves performance hasnt been so good that his position in Cooperstown is assured even with mediocre performance from here on out. He has had a HOF peak but he needs to put another 2 to 3 good seasons around and hit counting stat milestones to complete his case. He has slowed down a bit since 2017. Still he had a 5 WAR season which is only adding to his case. His statcast page is a bit more concerning. While Altuves plate discipline and contact numbers look ok and his profile should overall keep him as a full-time starter theres some big problems. Altuve has almost no power. His recent approach has been trading elite contact for good power in a HR park in Minute Maid but his xSLG is almost 60 points lower than his actual slugging and it seems likely that Altuve will regress from being about a 30 HR hitter to more like a 10-15 HR hitter. His plate discipline is ok but I could see Altuve regressing into more of a 110 OPS+ above average hitter and while that I think is fine if puts up another season like 2022 or so and can stay in a bit longer it will make his case a bit harder. 

The final elephant in the room is the Astros cheating scandal. My guess is it wont matter that. Altuve likely wont appear on the ballots for another 10-12 years and thats a lot of time for writers to care a lot less. Altuves own role in the scandal is pretty questionable as both his teammates accounts and the statistical evidence suggested he didnt want much of a part in it and finally I dont think it was nearly a big of a deal as PEDs in most voters minds given what Ive read. I think Altuves case might run into trouble if he ends up right on the cusp and the hall doesnt let Beltran in which is a real possibility for altuve. If hes 65 WAR+ then I dont think it will matter 

**Gerrit Cole** \- Coles case in a nutshell is this. In a generation of pitchers that have a 2-3 great seasons and then burn out. Cole can solidly through 180+ IP year after year, a very above average level and sometimes even at an exceptional level. Hes done that 7 of the last 8 years. No one thinks that Cole is the equal to Kershaw or Scherzer. Hes probably not going to become a legend of the game, but hes probably the best pitcher of his generation besides DeGrom and he stands out more because theres not much wrong with him. At 31 with over 30 WAR for a pitcher with this generations use patterns hes killing it. He has both a solid amount of great and good season behind him to make a case. I think hes solidly been on peoples lips for a while as one of the best pitchers in baseball at least until this year so I think the perception is there for Cole which is often very important for the vote. Hes pretty good at staying healthy so far as well. Traditional voters biggest gripe with modern pitchers is that they dont throw enough and Cole is in the lead for his generation to finish with the most innings pitched so I think thats really really going to help him if he pulls it off. The sticky stuff controversy prob won't matter. Most players and increasingly most writers are realizing that the problem is less to do with better morals from the pitcher than MLB changing the ball ever year and making it hard for players to adjust and so they do what they can. I think its probably overstated how slick the ball is but the court of public opinion is shifting in the pitchers favor. I do think it would be helpful for Cole to have another great year sans sticky stuff just to prove that its not all about the sticky stuff. 

So Coles past is a solid A- for me in terms of the hall. His present is a little more concerning. Hes still a good pitcher but the last two years and especially this year have been more above average than top of the league like. The Strikeouts are still there but the ERA and WAR are slipping. Cole might get a ring this year which will help him a bit but its definitely not his finest season. 

Im not that concerned though. First Cole has room for error unlike many guys. He has 1500 IP behind him at 31 which gives him both room to miss a season and a compiler candidacy to fall back on if his ERA drops a bit. Second is the competition on sustained dominance is very weak and I think Cole has a good 2 season lead on any middle career guy beside DeGrom right now so his relative ranking among his peers is going to be hard to lose. What really sells me on Cole being able to continue this is why hes been struggling. He still has the stuff, hes not struggling with injuries, the problems have mostly been at little bit worse control and placement. These are things that are generally the easiest to address with training and approach change. I give Cole a solid 80% chance of coming back into contention as a top of the league pitcher.

As for what Cole need to do to be a HOFer. I think another two years of being a solid 5 WAR pitcher and then coasting enough to hit even 55 WAR would probably make him an easy in given the change in pitcher use. He still needs to pitch another 6-7 full seasons but I think hes very much on track. 

**Borderline - Its all going to come down to their late 30s and I think its reasonable to bet either way havent hamstrung themselves but dont have much room for error either**

**Giancarlo Stanton** \- I dont think Stantons recent decline in performance is really indicative of an unavoidable downward spiral that will see Stanton fail to reach the milestones he needs in his 30s. That being said I do think Stantons case is beginning to run into problems. Stanton broke into the majors early and hot. By the end of his age 28 season he had already accumulated over 300 HRs and 40 WAR won an MVP and lead the league in slugging twice. Stantons remarkable 59 HR season in 2017 really cemented the feeling that Stanton might be the pre-eminent slugger of his generation. This give Stanton some room for error but hes begun to use a lot of it. 

The last 4 seasons have been plagued with injuries and when he has played the numbers havent quite been the same. So far hes only put up 4.7 WAR since 2019. These injuries have sapped him both of time and of his ability to be an above average corner outfielder. Thats a skill that may never return for Stanton as the Yankees may not wish to risk their injury prone slugger in the field. If these problems continue Stanton will not have a HOF career. On the bright side Stantons expected stats are quite good. A quick glance at his statcast reveals a player that should be near the top of the league even if injuries are holding him back. He has a 99 AVG exit velocity and a 99 barrel It seems likely that healthy Stanton could get to 60 WAR and 500 HRs a combination of which would probably guarantee a spot in Cooperstown. Some of his low BA this season seems to be more the result of bad BABIP luck than anything else giving him some easy ways to improve. While injuries have sapped him of some skills. His ability to hit 30 HRs a season is not one of them which while likely be very helpful to his case. 

I dont think Stanton has that much more room to miss time for injuries or not return to being at least 4 WAR player but I do think that its well within Stantons capabilities to do so. We will have to see if Stanton can play a full quality season sometime in the next two years before deciding to either put him a tier above or drop him into a more unlikely candidate. 

**J.T Realmuto** \- Realmuto has been a very consistent jack of all trades master of none as catcher. His career 113 OPS+ while hardly eye-popping is quite good for a modern catcher. He is an ok pitch-framer who is a very good defender in more traditional areas. The combo of this routinely allows Realmuto to put up 4 WAR seasons. In 2022 Realmuto broke from being a very good catcher slowly making his case by consistency to being a great catcher. He got his OPS+ up to 129 and had a very good season on the field combining for a 6.5 WAR season. He also for a catcher in this generation has pretty good accumulation stat having been a full-time catcher without sharing the role much since 2015. I think Realmuto maybe took top spot for a catcher of his generation from Grandal for sabermetric fans and is competing for the title with Perez for traditional fans but despite his great seasons in some ways his case has worsened with the debut of Kirk and Rutschman. Realmuto, Perez, and Grandal were all borderline candidates competing to be the best catcher after Posey and Rodriguez retired. Now they have arguably stronger competition coming up from behind that may make their careers look dimmer in comparison. It remains to be seen if these players will eclipse Realmuto and Perez and whether Realmuto can remain either as consistently good as he has been into his mid 30s or repeat a strong 6 WAR season like he did this year. However I think if Realmuto remains as good as he has been he will probably get into Cooperstown. I dont think he has too much room for error though. 

**Salvador Perez -** Above all Salvador Perez is just a very weird candidate. While the controversy mostly lies with Perez defense the bat side of things is also pretty interesting. His OPS+ 104 is fine for a catcher but not going to make his case that being said its a weird 104. His 268BA and 463 SLG are pretty good for a catcher and with 223 Home Runs entering at his age 33 season Perez is a threat to get pretty high on the positional leaderboard for home runs. He has led the league in HRs once and his 2020-2021 performance were HOF caliber hitting at least for a catcher. If he was able to do that again in 2022 I would have probably put him in the 50-50 but it seems he might return to his old offensive profile and hes also getting up there in age so I wouldnt count on many 30+ HR seasons from here on. At 4794 PA Perez is on the lower end of on track for a catcher on accumulation but isnt going to win bonus points there. If he can play till hes 40 that will be helpful The problem is Perez never walks and so his OPS+ is cratered by terrible plate discipline. This is probably the best way to get a low OPS+ as a lot traditional voters dont care that much about walks but it does take him from being a solidly above average hitting catcher to being an about average hitting catcher. I see this as something thats going to cause a big traditional non traditional divide if Perez can get the HR totals. 

The real controversy though is on his defensive performance. Prior to framing he was seen as the AL counterpart to Yadier Molina and won 5 gold gloves. An average hitting gold glove catcher is a strong HOF candidate but then came pitch framing measurements. All of a sudden Perez became a below average catcher. Which I think to the extent that it makes Perez a pretty run of the mill player outside of his great offensive 2020-2021 stretch rather than an all-star level player for seven season is fatal to his case. Pitcher framing is probably something that the most traditional voters will ignore. It would have become widely adopted among even the more casual sabermetric aware voters in a few years had pitch-framing remained part of the game but with auto-umps making the skill obsolete I see it as something thats going to not get disseminated/somewhat forgotten in 10 years among non stat oriented voters. It also allows Perez to maybe compete for accolades and regain his defensive reputation without his biggest weakness. Theres also still unmeasured game calling and pitcher management skills. Given how well pitchers have performed in Kansas City I think Perez is probably pretty good at these things so I genuinely think its kind of impossible to say how writers and especially the players of the VC will evaluate him. 

The final part of the equation is the narrative. I think that Perez with the WS MVP and being a big part of the KC Royals gets a bit of a narrative boost. More importantly I think that Perez is in contention with three players for the best catcher post Molina which I think is helpful for a HOF case.  By the stats the right answer is probably Grandal who was the best pitch framer and has the highest OPS+ of the group despite a bit of a weakness on traditional catcher defense but Grandal took PEDs so thats a major knock against him. Grandals awful year this year I think puts Perez in good position to take the lead The other candidate is Realmuto who is kind of the jack of all trades master of none. I think its all going to come down to how Salvy finishes his career and I see it as very much wide open with neither possibility being more or less likely. Its going to be hard but I think its possible that the narrative will settle on salvy being the best of the three and the number of really sabermetircally inclined voters may not be large enough to prevent him getting in. Until Bobby Abreu begins perfoming well on ballots Ill be skeptical that sort of people who understand sabremetrics as much as r/baseball never mind fan graph writers are really driving the ballot all that much. 

**Stretches - Could conceivably get there with a strong over-performance in their 30s but its an uphill battle and most of these players wont** 

**George Springer -**  Springer is a consistently very good player that has had trouble crossing the line to becoming a genuine star. In his last 8 seasons, hes had 5 seasons with more than 4 WAR + a strong 2020 that would have likely been another, 4 All-Star Games, and 2 silver sluggers. However only in 2019 did Springer finish top 10 in MVP voting and put up a season significantly above 5 WAR. So we have a player who is in range to have a long enough peak to be a HOFer but is a bit short on having a high enough peak. These players usually have to make their case on narrative and accumulation. Springer is also a behind on accumulation 34 WAR entering ones age 33 season is on the lower end of plausible. His traditional case also suffers from only about 4500 PA and a balanced offensive profile that will leave him low on many leaderboards. Springers narrative is also quite bad. His participation in the Astros Sign Stealing scandal while not disqualifying is going to hurt him if he ends up on the margins. Unlike Altuve, Springer was by all accounts a fairly enthusastic participant. Hes never really been the heart and soul of either the Astros or Blue Jays teams and as mentioned earlier hes languished as a player whose never really been recognized as a star with tons of hype surrounding them. 

Its pretty clear to me that the only path for Springer to get into the hall is to play as a consistently good player late into his 30s/early 40s without much room for error. That might plausibly allow him to establish a reputation as a long-lasting and reliable veteran while putting him around where he needs to be statistically. Like all of the sleepers I choose I think Springer has the talent to do that but its more than a stretch. Hes coming off a strong 2022 season but we have seen his fielding decline over the past few years putting more pressure on his bat. His statcast page while indicating a player that still has good years ahead of him did follow the natural age curve of decline that will catch up with springer eventually. Springer is going to have to over perform and I think its unlikely that he does enough to be a HOFer but I dont thinks out of the range of possibilities. 

**Marcus Semien** **-** Semien is pretty crazy player. From 2019 to 2022 Semien has the 2nd highest rWAR of any batter (not counting Ohtani). He finished 3rd in MVP voting twice and has 186 HRs as a middle infielder entering his age 32 season. I think that Semien has three problems that are likely to keep him out of the Hall of Fame. First, Semien got off to a very slow start in his majors. From 2013-2018 Semien was merely average and that really puts him far behind where he needs to be at 32. Semiens second biggest problem is that his WAR probably over-states his reputation narratively while also being a bit low and easy to poke at. I think the average person probably would not place Semien as one of the top 5 players since 2019 before consulting WAR. At 35 WAR at 32 hes also a bit of a stretch to get to 60 WAR even with the fact that he has a good trajectory. So I dont see him having strong support from either traditional or sabermetric voters without consistently putting up 5 WAR seasons for at least the next 5 seasons something that I doubt Semien will do given normal aging. Finally I think the biggest flaw in Semiens case is that by going to a HR unfriendly pitchers park in Texas he hurt his ability to sell his case to traditional voters. Toronto Semien his 45 HRs a fact that will be appreciated by everyone whereas Ranger Semien got to 5.7 WAR with a mix of good defense, good power, and a lot of positional adjustment for doing it all as a 2B. I think thats a much harder sell. Semien really did turn his 2022 around in the second half and adjusted to rangers stadium and I think second half Semien was still good enough to build a long peak that might get some notice but its an uphill battle and one I will have to see how he performs with his second half adjustment next year before I can truly believe its possible. Still given that Semien has had very good seasons in 2019, 2021, and 2022 Im going to give him a hair above a 20% chance if we count VC elections and keep him here until he slows down considerably or puts together another MVP-5+ season 

**Anthony Rizzo -** Rizzos career thus far has certainly put him in a plausible position to get into the HOF but I have my doubts. 

The big distinguisher for Rizzo is that he was one of the key if not the most prominent cub in the 2016 World Series run. Rings always help a HOF candidacy but the Cubs breaking their hundred year losing curse really is a big selling point if Rizzo can get in range statistically. Both the BBWA but especially the VC care a lot about the history of the game not just the statistical contribution and I see any member 2016 cubs team as having a very easy tiebreaker as long as they got in reasonable range of a HOF candidacy. 

The next question is are Rizzos stats good enough to get there. Looking at the past I would say the answer is yes. Without the ring Id put him at about a 30-70 just based on past performance but with it I think if Rizzo played similarly going forward with an average age curve he would probably make it. 30.2 WAR with one abbreviated season by 32 is a little low but perfectly do-able for a HOF run. His bat is a bit of an issue as 127 OPS+, 265 BA, 278 HRs are not great for his age but his 4 gold gloves help balance that out and again he really only needs to be 1st tier HOVG + narrative its not a killer. Still this is a bit of a weak statistical profile for the Hall of Fame.

The problem I see for him is that things look like they are going to get worse. To start Rizzo is pretty clearly the 3rd best 1B of his age group way behind Goldschmidt and Freeman and those comparison can hurt you. The major selling point of Rizzo being close to that tier was that Rizzo was a spectacular 1st baseman with the platinum glove and could have maybe made himself into a bit of a Keith Hernandez figure despite being 10-15 points behind on the OPS+ or WRC+. Theres two major problems with that. First 1B defense has historically not been given much appreciation by traditional voters. The second is that Rizzo is losing that part of his skillset making him more of a pure bat candidate going forward. 

Which brings me to what I see as the bigger problem for Rizzo. I dont really see the future skillset that Rizzo is going to leverage to be a 3-4 WAR player in his 30s. Without the glove Rizzo was going to need a better than a 120 OPS+ bat and Rizzo has accomplished this at 32 by being a 131 OPS+ bat but that leaves little room for age related regression and Rizzo does not have the WAR to coast through his 30s and make much of a case for himself either. This year hes kind of become a pure power hitter. His xBA is already only 239 meaning hes not getting much good contact and thus is really relying on power to carry him through his 30s and with an AVG exit velocity at 57 and Barrel at 76 his xSLG is a bit lower than his performance. So he doesnt have the best base to start losing power from and if he start losing power he can in 2-3 seasons become a 1 WAR player which I think will put Rizzo out of range. The other thing is if he retires with a batting average in the 250s as his offensive profile seems to be heading towards hes going to have to rely more on some good power numbers. While I dont think not reaching 500 hrs is much of a problem for Goldschmidt and Freeman who have balanced profiles that will probably see career BAs in the 280s if not higher. Rizzo needs those HRs more if he cant start putting some contact on the ball and right now 274 HRs at 32 does not make him a very likely candidate to reach 500 and certainly a 50-50 to reach 400. Its always possible that players get better in their 30s with adjustments but players that have started decline in their lates 20s and early 30s are usually good candidates for those that wont make it. I see a lot of those warning signs for Rizzo. 

**Zack Wheeler** \- Wheeler right now is pitching like a HOF pitcher. One could make a good argument that he was the best pitcher of 2021. In 2022 he was not quite as good but still manage to be a top 10 pitcher and accumulate 5 rWAR with stiffer competition. His statcast is quite good as well so barring injury theres little reason to think its a fluke and he may be able to mantain his status in the future. His big problem is his past though. Wheeler had his first good season at the age of 28 in 2018. His 750 IP at 100 ERA+ at the beginning of his age 30 season is better than nothing but its a pretty hard to pitch your way into the Hall of Fame entirely in your 30s. Its not unheard of and pitchers are more likely to break out in their 30s than hitters are although on the flip side there also more likely to burn out. Pitchers are just generally harder to predict. Randy Johnson has only 19.7 WAR at the end of his age 30 season and would go on to be one of the best pitchers of all time. However it is significantly less likely than not. 

Theres two things that do work in Wheelers favor 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Voters are usually slightly more sympathetic to finishing strong, starting weak than vice-versa. Mostly because it leaves a player retiring closer to the height of his fame and popularity. This effect is on the margin not major
2. Wheelers competition is weaker than average. The Hall of Fame is both a relative and absolute competition. If your the 8th best short-stop in a generation of very strong shortstops your less likely to get in then if your the same quality of player but are the 2nd best of that generation. However Its still more absolute than relative. The HOF has often just skipped a generation of relatively weak candidates at a position. However its going to be a moderate bump in Wheelers favor if he does establish himself as one of the better pitcher. 

What would Wheeler need to do to pitch his way into HOF contention? 

Bare minimum he would need to pitch 5 more seasons including this one as a top 10 pitcher (maybe 4 if one of those is a cy-young). Then he would need to reach \~2400 IP, get his career ERA+ above 120, get to 50 WAR and pitch into his 40s. 

Could Wheeler do it? 

I think he has the talent to do so. He has no room for a bad injury so its just luck at that point. I think if he was 2 years younger I would believe in him. I think given his age it would be a surprising reversal of the age curve. Id give it 25% odds. Its more likely than people think but not very likely. If he repeats this season in 2023 and 2024 I would start to give him the benefit of the doubt. For now no. 

**Christian Yellich** \- Yellich had a dramatic drop-off from back to back MVP-1 and MVP-2 seasons in 2018 and 2019 to about an average full time starter. Has Yellich fallen too far behind to possibly come back and is a comeback even possible at this point?

To the first question I think the answer is solidly that he still could. Yellich while no longer ahead of the curve and with little room for further error still has a past resume strong enough to get in the hall especially if we are including an eventual VC induction. 36.1 WAR entering an age 31 season is a bit low but not disastrously so. Hes a contact hitter so hes likely to over perform his WAR with traditional voters. He has a short but high peak that netted him two batting titles and MVP as hardware. I think maybe most importantly unlike many of the stars of the game who debuted after college Yellich had a full 20s of accumulation putting him easily on track with a comeback to reach milestones like 2500 hits and 10000 PA although his power numbers are not great outside of his peak. 

The second question is harder to answer.I think to state the obvious if Yellichs early 30s resemble his mid 20s he will have a good shot at making the HOF whereas if they resemble his late 20s he will not. For the last 3 years after his knee injury Yellich hasnt been bad but hes been very average. 2022 was a slight improvement from 2021 but still nowhere near where Yellich needs to be. Entering his age 31 season, Yellich has enough years left in his prime to possibly come back but missing two in a row makes it quite hard to do so. The more important question is does Yellich still have the skills to be his old self. A glance at Yellichs statcast page paints an unclear picture. On one hand his expected stats are across the board slightly better than his actual stats making it likely that Yellich will improve to be more like a 120 OPS+ hitter next season. Thats obviously not quite good enough for a pure bat. On a lot of things Yellichs stats are pretty decent. He has good plate discipline, a good hard hit percentage, and good exit velocity but is having trouble making quality contact with a high whiff and low barrel percentage. Yellichs speed which has helped him get doubles and some stolen bases to round out his profile will inevitably fade with age as well. Overall it seems Yellichs issue is one of poor swing timing. This is an issue that is often fixable but is not necessarily so. I think anyones guess as to whether Yellich can make adjustment and return to the 140 OPS+ hitter that he would need to become to get on track again. I think the potential is still there for Yellich unlike Bellinger but Ill believe it when I see it. On the other hand I do think 2023 is pretty make or break for Yellich in terms of amount of time left and another season without some improvement would probably put Yellichs bid in longshot territory. Until either of those things happen I think Yellich is a sleeper candidate, one that can emerge again but as of now doesnt look likely. 

**Anthony Rendon** \- At the end of last year I thought that people were counting Rendon out too soon. One bad injury ridden year is not usually enough evidence to paint a clear picture of decline. However we now have two injury ridden years of pretty mediocre play and that I think that is much more worrying and puts Rendon too far behind the curve to be a likely HOF candidate.

Rendon up to his age 31 season was probably just on track to be a Hall of Famer. At 32.2 WAR, 127 OPS+, and 4159 PA, and good defense at a high value position with a good trajectory he was a little light but certainly had a good chance of having a HOF career. Rendon had hit his stride in 2017 and played the next 4 years as a Top 10 player. He was arguably the hitting star of the 2019 nationals team that one the World Series which gave him so narrative to back him up. While a good resume its not one that was so overwhelming to give him a lot of room for error. Injuries have no robbed Rendon of two prime seasons for a player that was already on the lighter side of on track. Thats going to require a major over-performance in his late 30s to recover from. The recent trajectory has not been good the games he played in 2022 were better than 2021 but Im now pretty skeptical that he has a comeback in him. 

That being said at 33 with the demonstrated potential of being a 150 OPS+ hitter just two years ago he has the potential to be a great player again and has just enough time that he could maybe pull it off. I do think 2023 is a make or break year for Rendon. If he cant play a full season as at least a 4 and probably 5 WAR player again I dont think he has time to make it anymore.

We all know this will never happen, but I wondered what if? So I took to MLB The Show and got to simulating (as the Yankees, of course) - before every series, I would save, sim, and if I didn't sweep my opponent, it was reload time to try again (I'll have some metadata towards the end of the post).

&amp;nbsp;

Some other interesting tibits:
- Chapman was the only pitcher to not earn a win but did pick up 5 saves. 
- As a team we had 13 blown saves on the season
  
&amp;nbsp;

So obviously the team was built on the backs of great performances all around, but outside of the pitching wins and losses, nothing seems too out of the ordinary (Stanton's slash line being the only huge outlier in some respects). Using the formula for Pythagorean wins, this team would expect to finish 134-28, still far beyond the regular season records of 117 wins.
  
&amp;nbsp;

Some metadata stuff:
This took about 3 hours to sim through a whole season, but I could have probably done it in less than 2 if I was really trying. I occasionally stopped to look at stats and stuff.
  
&amp;nbsp;

Here is a list of how many simulations it took to get through each series. As you can see, generally the further I got through the season the less sims I needed. I think this is probably because I had a lot of players who were 'hot', and I think that might affect how things work in sims. Every series that took 10+ tries was a 4-game set except for the one against Seattle which was only 3 games. I have no idea why it took so many tries to get through:

TEX: 19

HOU: 35

#**#70 - Alejandro Kirk - Toronto Blue Jays [](/TOR) - Catcher**

**Written by:** /u/ethanlikesbeer

In a time where a good catcher is an extremely valuable commodity in baseball, the Toronto Blue Jays somehow wound up with three of them; veteran Danny Jansen, top prospect Gabriel Moreno and 2022 standout Alejandro Kirk. Toronto employed a crowded stable of backstops, but Kirk separated himself from the others both at the plate and behind it.

Over 139 games Kirk produced a .285/.372/.415 triple slash line, 33 extra base hits, more walks than strikeouts and a 129 wRC+. He also finished top-5 in baseball in catcher framing runs and a .996 fielding percentage overall behind the dish. The ability to be productive both offensively and as a receiver is highly coveted, and it feels like Kirk was overlooked for a strong campaign, especially when you consider hes just 24.

#**#69 - Gunnar Henderson - Baltimore Orioles [](/BAL) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** u/bluspy88

Though appearing in just 34 MLB games this season, Gunnar Henderson seems poised to be a big part of what is shaping into an exciting young core in Baltimore. He put up solid offensive numbers in both AAA and the majors this year, including a .349 OBP in Baltimore, and showed off his defensive acumen that drew comparisons to former Orioles star Manny Machado. Originally drafted as a shortstop, it remains to be seen if he will stay at third base, where most of his appearances came this year. But with the recent #1 overall pick, shortstop Jackson Holliday, being drafted by Baltimore this year, this seems like the likely plan for GM Mike Elias. Fans coming to Camden Yards are likely to see Henderson manning the hot corner for the Os in years to come.

#**#68 - Jeff McNeil - New York Mets [](/NYM) - Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/futhatsy

To quote Mets play-by-play man Gary Cohen, Jeff McNeil ""had his magic wand back"" in 2022. Jeff himself prefers a different phrase: ""Dirtbag Baseball,"" referencing his days as a [Long Beach State Dirtbag](https://longbeachstate.com/news/2022/11/10/baseball-dirtbag-alum-jeff-mcneil-earns-silver-slugger.aspx). In a sport that is increasingly concerned with hitting the ball both hard and far, Jeff doesn't do either particularly often. Out of 130 qualified hitters last year, he ranked 115th in average exit velocity and 120th in barrel rate. Despite this, ""dirtbag baseball"" took over, and things worked out for Jeff anyway. He won the National League batting title with a .326 average, and his 143 wRC+ lead National League second baseman by a whopping 34 percentage points. He was a legitimate star last year, he just did it like a dirtbag.

So how exactly *does* he do it? First of all, he doesn't strike out. He was the only player in baseball last year to have a swing% among the top 20 qualified hitters (53.8%) and have a whiff% in the bottom 20 (15.9%). This rare combination of aggression and contact made him the hardest man to strike out in the National League with a K% of just 6.8%. But avoiding strikeouts is just one part of his game, the hits came with his line drive rate. Jeff McNeil was the only player in baseball eclipse a 30% line drive rate in 2022, hitting for a .641 average on those line drives, which lead him to the aforementioned batting title. He is also an exceptionally balanced hitter, making him almost impossible to game plan against. Against fastballs last year, he hit .316 and slugged .452, against breaking pitches he hit .314 and slugged .453, and against off speed he hit .384 and slugged .465. With no shift he had a wOBA of .356, and with a shift he had a wOBA of .397. Of the nine quadrants of the strike zone, he hit over .250 and slugged over .315 in all of them. There are not any obvious weaknesses here to attack. You just have to hope he gets himself out. 

So when you add it all up, you have a guy that swings a lot, whiffs very little, and hits line drives against any type of pitch in any location. Sprinkle in some very solid defense at second base and the versatility to play a serviceable third base and corner outfield, and you end up with the 6 WAR, All-Star, Silver Slugger, Batting Champ, Magic Dirtbag that is Jeff McNeil.

#**#67 - Kevin Gausman - Toronto Blue Jays [](/TOR) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/youdontknowhimnow

What does Kevin Gausman have in common with Keegan Akin and Tyler Anderson? They throw an ungodly amount of fastballs down the middle. And this is why I love Kevin Gausman.

Now, a list of reasons why throwing down the middle sucks:

* You give up hard hit balls
* You give up barrels
* You give up line drives
* You don't get chases
* They swing a lot
* You don't get a ton of whiffs

Now, a list of reasons why throwing down the middle is good:

* Tunnelling

That's about it.

Tunnelling is a decently old baseball concept only recently being quantified. Some believe in it, some don't, and some believe in it too much. It's like a religion. Kevin Gausman is a master of tunnelling, and his tunnelling skills have led him to a 2.81 ERA in 2021 and a 2.38 FIP in 2022. Yes, I am cherry picking the stats that make Kevin Gausman look the best. Stats are always great when they prove your points.

Anyways, back to the fastball down the middle thing. Kevin Gausman has a chase rate of 42.7%. This is great for walks, since if he throws out of the zone, they swing at it and he never gets to 4 ball counts. His fastball is thrown at 95, and he gets Joe Random deadzone movement with good active spin. I don't know how to tell you this, but Kevin Gausman's fastball in a vacuum sucks. The fastball gets 17.5"" of rise and 10.6"" of armside run. Given the fact that this is a meh movement profile with eh velo and down the middle, you should not be shocked when I tell you that the fastball gets hit hard and gets barrelled. His fastball gets hit hard 50.4% of the time and gets barrelled 11.3% of the time. 

So, how is he good? This is the story of his splitter. His splitter separates about 20.5"" from his fastball using a bit of that Pythagorean theorem, and it tunnels really well with Gausman's gyro slider. The slider and splitter create a great secondary horizontal tunnel, separating 16.3"" horizontally and separating vertically (in terms of drop) 2.3"". The splitter is also thrown nowhere near the zone. It's thrown in the zone 23.8% of the time. And the results are staggering. The splitter is chased 50.9% of the time, and batters only make contact with the pitch in the zone 73.2% of the time. In total, batters have swung and missed in 26.4% of all splitters from Gausman. It's an excellent pitch, and he's able to get strikeouts and avoid walks by throwing it. 

Gausman's slider is a gyro cutter. I don't have that much analysis here. 3 inches rise, 1 inch of sweep, and batters have a bit of a contact issue against it. They don't chase, but it gets swinging strikes 13.6% of the time. It's decent, and it's needed vR. Splitters and changeups work best/are used more against opposite handed batters, so Gausman has some platoon splits between righties and lefties. Oh, well. He's got his splitter, and he can just trust that and his command vR more.

Kevin Gausman has been quietly amazing for the past 2 years. This contract is frickin amazing. He's under contract until 2027, and he's going to be an ace in Candad. Congrats Candad!!!!!!! !

#**#66 - Luis Robert - Chicago White Sox [](/CWS) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** u/SeeYaLaterDylan

Many of Byron Buxtons pros and woes can be transfixed onto Luis Robert, a shooting star of strength and speed who has yet to play a full, proper season in the majors. Robert debuted during the shortened 2020 season, tore his hip flexor in 2021 and then missed more than 60 games in 2022 because of wrist, leg and head injuries. Roberts advantage is that hes still only 25, meaning he still has plenty of time to get himself and the White Sox back on track, although that may require sacrificing a little bit of the recklessness he's known for in center field (reminiscent of Bryce Harper's nagging issues early in his career). Beyond staying on the field, hell eventually need to improve his abysmal chase rate, which will hopefully lead to better swings and more [500-foot tanks and bat flips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Je7-Lhz34).

#**#65 - Bryan Reynolds - Pittsburgh Pirates [](/PIT) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** u/throbbingkitty

Is it fair to consider someone underrated when theyve finished 4th in RoY voting, 11th in MVP voting and one All-Star nod in their four seasons in the league? Sure, were all in awe of Ronald Acuñas [natural ability](https://www.mlb.com/video/ronald-acuna-jr-homers-13-on-a-fly-ball-to-right-center-field-ozzie-albie), and sure, despite a (questionable case of [ringworm](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/padres/story/2022-08-14/zeigler-baseball-san-diego-padres-fernando-tatis-jr-clostebol-explanation-drug-test-steroid-ringworm), Fernando Tatis Jr. is another exciting, young player, and SURE, Juan Soto eats mayonnaise sandwiches \[no source\], but Bryan Reynolds may be the best kept secret in Pittsburgh outside of being the [pickle capital of the world.](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/blog/pittsburgh-is-picklesburgh/) Reynolds rookie year was in 2019, and his consortium of rookie colleagues included guys like Pete Alonso, Yordan Alvarez, Brandon Lowe, and Luis Arraez, all of whom have become pretty special players in the MLB. However, Reynolds, a former 2nd round pick of the Giants, has continued to shine where others have sputtered (or suspended). Reynolds finished his 2022 campaign 5th in OPS, 6th in OPS+, and 5th in wRC+ among all CFs in the league, and his 12.4 fWAR is 5th among CFs since 2019. With his recent trade request, Bryan is not spurning his Pirates organization, but instead is vying to become a household name for all baseballs fans, to be touted as one of the best outfielders in the game, and a reactionary inclusion into your vocabulary as meander through the caverns of your gray matter during a meaningless sprint through varying MLB-related Sporcle quizzes, slowly passing the time until in the dead cold of Winter you await your ESPN alert that pitchers and catchers report in 12 days.

#**#64 - Marcus Semien - Texas Rangers [](/TEX) - Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/FederalLeagueMVP

It's 2015, and the Oakland Athletics have this poignantly atrocious short stop named Marcus Semien. The Baseball world sends out a Rhett Butler-esque ""I don't give a damn"" attitude about the poor teams of the league, especially when they're in a down cycle. So back in 2015, a tree struck out in the woods and no one heard it. This is the story to one of baseball's greatest turnarounds.

That rookie year iteration of Semien looked on track to break the all time record for errors at short stop and stunk at the plate. But as Justin Verlander once remarked, Semien had the best work ethic in the league. By 2019 he reached dizzying heights at the plate (138 wRC+) and noteworthy defense. And, he never strayed from the process. For example, in the final inning of the '20 ALDS the A's embarked upon a final, futile, attempt to take down the mighty Astros. Semien battles through a quality ab down by 7 runs which ended in an RBI single. His most recent postseason AB.

In '21 he went and posted the second best season of his career shuttling between home stadiums for the Jays (131 wRC+) and parlayed that into a mega-contract in Texas. How did he do in year one? Slashed .248/.304/.429, above league average hitting and 4+ WAR. Ho hum. Marcus Semien went from quietly bad to an unquestionable top 100 player through sheer will. It's a story we should all remember the next time we jeer a young yet bad player.

#**#63 - Bobby Witt Jr. - Kansas City Royals [](/KC) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/SeeYaLaterDylan

A lot of things went right and a lot of things went wrong for Bobby Witt Jr. in his first taste of the bigs.

The good: The Royals rookie hit 20 home runs and swiped 30 bases, joining Mike Trout, Ronald Acuña Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds as the only players to reach those marks at 22 or younger. His tools are as elite as advertised, particularly his speed, which Statcast rates as the very best in baseball.

The bad: He couldnt totally catch up to MLB pitching yet, hitting just .254 with a .294 OBP overall and struggling heavily against fastballs.

The ugly: While he had some flashy plays here and there, Witt may have been the worst defensive shortstop in the majors. He was worth -13 OAA, piled up 19 errors (16 at SS) and was unable to show off the range necessary to count on him at the position long term.

Kansas City clearly has a special talent with Witt. But hell need to patch a lot of holes in his game in order to reach his star potential over the next couple years, and the Royals will need to decide if he can improve enough to make shortstop his permanent defensive home  or if a move back to third base is inevitable.

#**#62 - George Springer - Toronto Blue Jays [](/TOR) - Center Fielder**

**Written by:** /u/otatoptroy

Springer embodies the ideal modern day leadoff hitter with his combination of power and plate discipline, a guy you want taking as many of the teams plate appearances as possible. When hes not blasting leadoff home runs, hes in the outfield playing like his hair's on fire and making reckless diving stops. Springer has had his fair share of injuries as a result, but Torontos offseason moves have set up a permanent move to right field to keep him healthier.

#**#61 - Clayton Kershaw - Los Angeles Dodgers [](/LAD) - Left-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/wharblegarblemuricah

Clayton Kershaw is this generations greatest pitcher, I dont care what you say, I dont care about the postseason outings, he is THE guy you wanted on the mound any given day. Even as his velocity diminishes little by little, he is still one of the best pitchers in the game. The Dodgers are more careful about his usage (HE HAD THAT PERFECT GAME RIGHT THERE DAVE WHYD YOU PULL HIM) and he has been battling injuries more often but heres this: in 2022, he had a 9.76 K/9, 1.64 BB/9, both of which were better than any of his seasons from 2008 to 2013.","baseball",52,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10adixf/rbaseball_top_100_players_for_the_2023_season_7061/"

**Hey Sportsfans**  it's time for **Week 14** of
r/baseball Power Rankings: These rankings cover all games played until the All Star Break. This coming Monday will be an ""off week"" -- we will post rankings, but it will be a joke where the voters judge teams on how much we like them. Taking the week off is good because so few games are played AND with more games to judge the following week we will see more of a shake up.

**Every voter has their own style / system and the only voting instructions are these:**

&gt;""To an extent determined individually, you must take into account how strong a team is right now and likely to be going forward. You must, to some degree, give weight to the events and games of the previous week.""

\#||Team||Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 60 wins before the break after a 4-2 week which was capped off with a series win against the Rays which solidified our spot at the top. The offense is otherworldly. The pitching is real good and gonna get better with Fried returning by the end of this month. To quote Freddie Mercury: ""don't stop me now, because I'm having a good time!"" I don't expect us to play at this INSANE pace the rest of the year, but we also might. Right now...it's really fun to be a Braves fan. |**60-29**
**2**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| It sure is a good thing the All-Star break was this week, the Rays came out Sunday looking refreshed and ready to go! Proud of our guys' showing in the game, still can't believe Randy won the derby with 57 homers! Just have to stay the course and keep the fingers crossed for no injuries, and hopefully this team can make a run in October! |**58-35**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+2**| Going into the All-Star break with a 5-game winning streak gives us some high hopes for the 2nd half. Bringing up Westburg and Cowser seems to have jump started the offense as well. Jackson Holliday also got promoted to AA and Coby Mayo to AAA. Going to be a great rest of this year and a super interesting trade deadline/offseason for the Orioles. Lots of decisions to make on this roster. Can't believe it was just 5 years ago this team (not the same players but same name team) lost 115 games. I enjoy this much more than that. |**54-35**
**4**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+2**| Being a Dodger fan can be rewarding sometimes. The team heads into the all star break in first place in the NL West going 5-1 over the last week and losing potentially only two pitchers for the season! The offense has been firing on all fronts warming up for the all star game and home run derby and Mookie Betts is your father.  |**51-38**
**5**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-2**| After years of being bottom dewellers and multiple 100 loss seasons, the Rangers see themselves with not only an above .500 record but also 1st place in the division at the All Star Break. This team has played lights out for a good part of the 1st half but the break could not have come at a better time as it has dropped 3 straight series and 4 out of the last 5. The 2nd half will be fun to watch and it's been great watching a fun team again but it's definitely the hope that will kill you. |**52-39**
**6**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**-2**| Zac Gallen and Corbin Carroll are ASG starters, and Lourdes Gurriel, Jr. and Geraldo Perdomo made the team, too. The Snakes finish the first half tied with the Dodgers for first in the NL West. However, the offense has been faltering, and the pitching becomes even more questionable with Drey Jameson going on the 60-day IL with an elbow issue. It will be paramount for the front office to acquire several pieces for this team to remain competitive in the cutthroat NL.  |**52-39**
**7**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| At the halfway point, it seems like 50% of the fanbase is ready to throw itself in front of the MMP train, and the other 50% is ready to throw Maldy or Dusty in front in the name of ""not my catcher."" All things considered - including our MANY injuries - 2nd place in the AL West is not a shabby place to be. Just because we aren't dominating the league doesn't mean all hope is lost.  |**50-41**
**8**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**+3**| One of the better weeks of the Blue Jays season, especially considering what we might've gotten back. Sweeping the White Sox and taking 2 of 3 from Detroit (and shout out to Tigers fans for getting that no-no; that was legitimately awesome for you guys) was great, especially with the comeback wins in there. But more importantly, Alek Manoah returned and actually threw what appeared to be major league quality innings! I didn't expect him back, but if he can just be a #5-level pitcher, on top of Ryu and Chad Green coming back, we're in great shape. Just need to boost those RISP numbers a bit. 50-41 at the break, still somehow in the division race with TB falling off the past month, and looking like a postseason contender again. Feels pretty good going into the extended time off.  |**50-41**
**9**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+1**| Q'hubo pues, whats up yall? We have arrived at that wonderful time of the year where jojo siwa says ""fuck me"" into a hot mic during the celebrity softball game and a bunch of dudes will hit dingers for two hours straight later this evening. Ah, the all star break. Obligatory shoutout to Jorge Soler and Luis Arraez for being selected as starters in the ASG, more on that in a sec. This past week we took a 4 game series against the cards (segura and edward cabrera for nolan, who says no?) and also won a 3 game series against the phillies (suck it ricky bottalico). The Marlins owner, Bruce Sherman, has recently reiterated statements made earlier this year about being willing to make trade deadline moves if the team was in a position to make a post season run. Well brucey, we have the best record in franchise history at the ASB. To quote one Rod Tidwell, ""SHOW. ME. THE MONEY"". Our starting pitching has remained solid, even Sandy found his groove last week against a good phillies lineup (once again, suck it ricky bottalico). Supposedly the team is gonna call up johnny ""5 earned runs by the 2nd inning"" cueto in order to load manage Eury Perez' first season in the bigs but honestly, it just smells like service time manipulation to me. I dont see how we can keep Eury in the minors for the rest of the season if we wanna make the playoffs. Cabrera is gonna start his rehab assignment this week but Rogers is gonna likely be out for another month and change. Limit Eury's innings but for gods sake dont send him down to the minors for the rest of the year. On the other side of the plate, things have been heating up. The recent call up of pitcher turned hitter Dane Meyer may have catalyzed the offense. Dude has been raking, with 4 multi hit games this week. Sure its a small sample size but Great Dane has also shown some great defense and solid baseball IQ in his short time in the majors. He better stay on the roster once jazz gets off the IL, send down Hampson or Burdick. Sucks that its happened right before the ASB, but its nice for a lot of your lineup to finish off the first half of the season strong. ASG starters Soler and Arraez have been leading this offense, but weve currently got 6 players in the lineup with an OPS over 750, which hasnt happened in a while by this point of the season. After the ASB were gonna start back up with a 3 game series in Baltimore and then scoot over to St lou. |**53-39**
**10**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**-2**| A 3 -3 week against the Mariners and Rockies is acceptable. Nobody is really going to complain when you go .500 in the last week before the All Star Break. Speaking of which, I only caught the lasst few innings and seeing Doval on the mound was dope. It would be cool if the rest of the baseball world. understood how crazy good this kid is. We probably would've had Estrada in the ASG as well, but he is the latest injury, till Aug. 4ish. Are things fine? I don't know; things sort of feel fine with this team. |**49-41**
**11**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| It was my birthday this past weekend, I should have been happy, gone out to party with friends, family, anyone. But I didnt. Im a coward, I cant face anyone, I dont want to be seen. What is a birthday? Its an arbitrary day where we celebrate becoming closer to death, an unavoidable and permanent end to our existence. The day came and passed, I tried to pretend it didnt happen, but everyone was online to remind me. I want to be honest with you guys, 100% honest. Im scared. I am scared, not just of my life, but of dying. Im almost 30, and Ive done&nothing. I have no special talents, Im not particularly intelligent in a meaningful way, Im not that good looking, Im not healthy enough to live past 50 probably, Im never going to find a girl to settle down with, Im never going to be remembered, Ill be lucky if 10 people come to my funeral. I never found a viable passion in life, well I do have a passion, but theres no point in pursuing it because the likelihood of success in that field is near 0, and I dont need to go even further in crippling lifelong debt just to get rejected in the end. I have nothing to look forward to, there is no one waiting for me anywhere. My siblings have both made it, successful lives and careers, but not me. I have nothing to do. My peak in life is probably going to be living in a 1 bedroom house I cant afford, driving a 2006 Nissan Altima, working 45 hours a week at a job I hate with nobody to come home to, and spending my nights alone watching CSI reruns. Thats more than likely the most Ill achieve, and thats something Ive got to make peace with. Im just scared of the end. I dont want to die, I dont want everything to end. What if theres nothing? What if the moment our brain ceases to work there is just empty non-existence? But that cant be, there has to be more, how do we know whats going on right now? I think of it like this, if you were to get amnesia tomorrow, would you even be experiencing today? Because all you would remember is waking up not knowing anything. There has to be more, If not, then is dying really the end? Guys, Im scared. At least the Reds are playing good. These sports are the only things giving me respite. For a few hours I can forget everything around me and get invested in grown men playing with balls. I can hold onto that for as long as possible, I have to hold on to that as long as possible. But for the love of god we need starting pitching help. |**50-41**
**12**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-3**|Going into the All-Star break 1 game out of last. No real timetable on Judge still. Severino looks awful. Hitters still not hitting&it's a good time to be a Yankee hater, i.e. every baseball fan that isn't a Yankees fan. Anything can happen after the all-star break, but even if this team makes the playoffs, how will they fare against the real contenders? My feeling? Not so good.  |**49-42**
**13**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+4**| Are we contending? Is this contending? There's an optimistic take for the Red Sox this year, where the rotation gets healthy down the stretch and the rookies keep improving. But, even with the potential of a Story/Sale return, I'm still in the sell camp at this point. Our window is wide open starting next year, and I'd rather be going all in on 2024-27 instead of betting on the health of our perpetually-broken rotation to suddenly come together. Alas, our upcoming three series against the A's, Cubs, and Mets are going to end up being far more influential on the direction at the deadline then anything a reddit power ranker has ever said. If the games keep being fun, who am I to complain. |**48-43**
**14**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies went 4-2 on their Florida road trip, sweeping the Rays and losing 2/3 to the Marlins. They head into the All-Star Break 7 games over .500 and a half game out of the 3rd Wild Card spot. This time last year they were 6 games over .500 and tied for the 3rd Wild Card spot. I don't think an NL East crown was ever really on the table, so all things considered we're in a pretty good spot, especially considering we were 7 games under .500 just under a month ago. The goal is the same as last year: sneak into the playoffs and use timely hitting and elite pitching to win playoff series. The pitching needs some work to get back to what it was last year, but the lineup is better than it was last year. It will be interesting to see how they approach the trade deadline in a fairly crowded NL Wild Card. |**48-41**
**15**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+3**| Well that was... unexpected. The M's made the best of a tough final week in the first half, and find themselves slowly clawing their way into things. It's still an uphill battle, but at least there's finally some hope shining through. I don't know what's gotten into Mike Ford, but it's certainly welcome. Up next: Hey now, You're an All-Star Game at T-Mobile Park, 3 vs. Beisbolcats |**45-44**
**16**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-1**| Somehow Milwaukee just continues to win with names I barely recognize.  Yelich is back to MVP form and it's just fun to see.    I want to mention the futures game from this past weekend.  RHP Jacob Misiorowski was absolutely dominant.  Absolutely insane fastball (100-102) and a filthy slider for a punchout pitch.  I don't know if he'll appear as a September callup, but I would be shocked if he doesn't.    Can today be over? I can't wait to go to the home run derby tonight. |**49-42**
**17**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-1**|The Twins flirted with competency this week by sweeping the Royals, before being swept themselves by the Orioles. They head into the break a game under .500, and having finally relinquished 1st place in the AL Central to Cleveland (0.5 GB). While the pitching staff has put up league-leading numbers for the first half, the offensive performance has been consistently underwhelming. The hope for the second half is that the offense can *finally* start meeting expectations and back up the incredible pitching.|**45-46**
**18**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+3**| I am glad to have some good baseball to reflect on, going into the break here. Winning 5 of 6 is a good start, and seeing both Java Joe and Snellzilla have great starts over the weekend, with Manny having a two homer game Sunday was quite the treat. There have been plenty of individual bright spots in '23 so far, but the team will have to come together if they want to make a run here. Personal note; I'm rooting for Rutschman in the home run derby!  |**43-47**
**19**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians broke 500. That hasn't happened in a while. We played two close games against the Braves and won one, and then we took three of four from the Royals. (Of course, the one we lost against the Royals was the one I went to.) We have a tough three series after the all star break - Rangers and Phillies have been great lately, and we don't know which version of the Pirates we're going to get. Speaking of the All-Star break, Josh Naylor should be an All-Star. |**45-45**
**20**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-8**| No one reads or cares about these blurbs except for the Reds guy's anyway, so I am going to go outside, touch some grass, smoke some grass, and try to stop thinking about how Mike Trout's days of being the best player in the game are almost assuredly done, how this team will not have made the playoffs once with Ohtani (he's leaving btw), and how we all are going to die one day and no one will be around to remember any of our names. Why do I give a fuck about this dumb sport again? Anyway, Sativa or Indica?  |**45-46**
**21**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-1**| While the Cubs had a winning record this week, it most probably was not enough to turn the tide as they are 5 games under .500 at the break. At least the series in New York was a sing that the team has not given up, highlighted by Jameson Taillon's first good performance with the Cubs |**42-47**
**22**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+1**|  |**42-48**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-1**| The Pirates began the year with a 20-8 record, their best start in decades. They enter the All-Star break with a 41-49 record, meaning that they went 21-41 since. To put that in perspective, the Pirates went 19-41 during the shortened 2020 season. Progress! |**41-49**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**| Worst first half in how long? Long enough to fire Mozeliak and most of the front office.  |**38-52**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| Sure, the boys only went 2-4 last week but I'm gonna call it a good week. In addition to throwing a combined no-hitter with Matt Manning, Jason Foley, and Alex Lange, Akil Baddoo and Riley Greene (my boiiii) returned, Jonathan Schoop was kicked to the curb, and we grabbed potentially the best five tool talent in the draft in Max Clark at 3rd overall. Clark brings the energy as well and hopefully can grow into one of the new faces of the game. Fun stuff.  |**39-50**
**26**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**|In the last 365 days, there is exactly 1 player with as many PAs as Tim Anderson (392) and a worse wRC+ (52!) and that player is Miguel Rojas. Miguel Rojas has not batted higher than 6th in the batting order this year (and is usually at 9) and has also ranked as one of the better defensive shortstops in the league. Tim Anderson has hit 1 or 2 EVERY SINGLE GAME he has started this year and is...not ranked as one of the better defensive shortstops. He has a  .234/.268/.280 slash line over 365 days and a -0.9 fWAR. In the middle of what was supposed to be their competitive window, the White Sox decided that having one of the worst 2 hitters in baseball bat at the top of their order every day was the best way to win. I understand that sometimes you have to let players play out of their struggles, but has no one in the organization decided ""Hey, maybe there's a different way to help a struggling player than simply do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over-"" I'm sorry, what was I talking about?|**38-54**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Nats fans are riding high from drafting someone dubbed ""The Mike Trout of College Baseball"" as we head into the All-Star break. This should be the 2nd consecutive quiet ASB for the Nats since the team stinks now. |**36-54**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| Rockies limped into the All-Star break with another one-win week.  The draft was pretty good, but the fact that, as many have pointed out, we only had three old dudes in our draft room is really indicative of what the Rockies are as a franchise. |**34-57**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| I want to rant about the Royals, but does it even matter? We all know this team is relevant every 30 years. Until then, it's going to be a clusterfuck of failed prospects, ridiculous draft picks, and uninspiring free agent signings. The Royals are the team everyone forgets about for decades and it's easy to see why. It just isn't worth the effort. |**26-65**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**| 25-67 at the break is truamatically bad, but that says more about April and May's poor roster building and bad luck than it does June's mediocrity. 13-17 in their last 30 sounds about right to me anyway. There's still not a lot of exciting ""things"" going on, as most great a's teams win despite all known odds or logic. Seems like Rooker is hot again, in time for a breakout preformance in the ASG. |**25-67**","baseball",53,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/14yootu/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_15_all_of_al/"

Nope. Not fine, it was about 103 degrees and God knows what the humidity was. 

Oh and it was field level on the 3rd base side lower seats. Aka all sun baby. Now I know why they were cheap. 

We got baked! Everyone on the lower seats moved up higher to get under the overhangs. We blasted through all our water bottles right away and had to go buy drinks at the vendors. We bought those battery operated fans and still no relief. 

By the 7th inning my now wife and I were so hot and tired, it's the only time we left the game early to this day. I don't know how the players did it.

#**#80 - Oneil Cruz - Pittsburgh Pirates [](/PIT) - Shortstop**

**Written by:** u/e_schlanzz

Billed as an athletic prospect with two plus-plus tools, Oneil Cruz burst onto the scene this year displaying all of that and then some. When I say that, of course I am referring to his 97.8 MPH throw from short to first and his 122.4 MPH exit velo on a line drive single off the RF wallboth statcast era records. The Dominican-born rookie showed he was human still, posting one of the highest K% of his career at any level, but possesses the ability to make the extraordinary look rather ordinary.

What strikes me most about Oneil is just the sound that is emitted from his bat. Search any video on Baseball Savant or Youtube of his extra base hits, they all sound the same. A terrifyingly loud crackor better yet, explosionas if a party snap is employed for extra effect. But theres no party favors here, just an incredibly large frame generating next-level bat speed thats ready to inflict punishment on the unfortunate white pearl next selected to face the wrath of Cruz.

His rather large frame leads to some defensive clunkiness at a position so often left to players of shorter stature. Then again, at 67 there arent many taller in MLBs history books. And even if he never overcomes that, his pure athleticism may allow him to play almost anywhere on the diamond. Especially at the plate, Cruz has shown an ability to adapt and adjust, projecting forward as a crucial player and human highlight reel for years to come.

#**#79 - George Kirby - Seattle Mariners [](/SEA) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/SeeYaLaterDylan

Could George Kirby be the breakout pitcher of 2023? The former Elon standout was already strong in his first stint with the Mariners. He placed sixth in AL Rookie of the Year voting and finished with a 3.39 ERA and 2.99 FIP over 130 innings. His mix of strikeout stuff (9.2 K/9) and control (1.5 BB/9) was his calling card. That 6.05 K/BB ratio was sixth among starters with at least 130 innings pitched, with only Aaron Nola, Kevin Gausman, Max Scherzer, Corey Kluber and Justin Verlander ahead of him. The development of his secondary pitches will likely determine if hes due for a big breakout. Otherwise, hell remain a stabilizing  if unexciting  force in Seattles rotation.

#**#78 - Jazz Chisholm - Miami Marlins [](/MIA)- Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/corygm

I guess no one told Jazz that 2022 wasnt a pandemic-shortened season, and that hed need to play a full 162-game slate in order to appear on the end-of-season leaderboards. Still, the 60-game appetizer Jazz offered up in 2022 was tantalizing: in only 241 PAs, Jazz posted a career high triple-slash (.254/.325/.535), upped his walk rate (6.7% to 8.7%), and lowered his strikeout rate (28.6% to 27.4%). His .282 ISO and 20 PA per SB rate were also towards the top of the class in those respective categories. Defensively, he looked right at home at 2B, where hes likely to play for as long as Miguel Rojas remains a Marlin. While theres some uncertainty as to how these improvements will hold up over the course of a full season, theres a lot to be excited about in 2023, where Jazz can hopefully play a full season as the Marlins table-setter.

#**#77 - Emmanuel Clase - Cleveland Guardians [](/CLE) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/FederalLeagueMVP

Emmanuel Clase started his pro-baseball career as a 17 year old in the Padres system. In typical Preller fashion, he traded a future star in his minor league system, this time to Texas. During an ill-fated attempt at contending, the Rangers traded Clase to Cleveland in a franchise defining blunder. This is the story of the Guardians electric closer, holding dominance over opposing hitters in the late innings. His iconic cutter reaches 99 MPH and opponents only hit .180 off it in '22. He contrasts this with a devastating slider than manages to fool even the best hitters.

Name a pitching statistic, and Clase will be near the top of the list. His 1.97 xERA, 3.7% BB%, and .219 xwOBA are all mind bending numbers to read. His 42 saves last season represent his usefulness in the Guardian's surprise season, and he's not even 25 yet! If you're into rating relievers on any top 100 list, Clase deserves to be the top AL closer you rank- and maybe the best overall.

#**#76 - Matt Chapman - Toronto Blue Jays [](/TOR) - Third Baseman**

**Written by:** u/throbbingkitty

Following the 2021 season, the Toronto Blue Jays elected to depart from their platoon situation at 3rd base between potential rising star Santiago Espinal and core utility player Cavan Biggio and decided to find themselves a more permanent replacement at the hot corner. Toronto ultimately took a chance on a former 1st rounder out of the Oakland As organization. After an arguably disappointing 2021 season where he posted the worst OPS+ of his career, Matt Chapman rebounded during his first season with the Blue Jays. His K% dipped from the low to mid 30s in 2020 and 21 to 27.5% in 2022 while improving his ISO 11 points year over year. Despite not being the offensive powerhouse as showcased in his age 25 and 26 seasons (posting an OPS of .864 and .848, respectively), his percentile rankings when compared to his hitting peers continues to highlight Chapmans ability to barrel the ball (88th percentile), his patience at the plate (chase rate 98th percentile; BB% 84th percentile), and his overall offensive value (3.4 oWAR). In addition to Chapmans production at the plate, his defensive abilities were on display once again, posting positive metrics in OAA (+1), DRS (+2), and UZR (+2.5). Chapman appears to be a solid stopgap for Toronto as they continue to build their core; however, with sustained ~30 HR potential at one of the most difficult defensive positions in the game, Chapman should expect to be courted by nearly half the league as he enters free agency in 2024.

#**#75 - Tommy Edman - St. Louis Cardinals [](/STL) - Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/bluspy88

The Cardinals utility man is coming off a strong campaign, putting up 6.4 WAR and playing all but 9 games of the regular season. After winning a Gold Glove in 2021 playing mostly at second base and some outfield duties, he started to see his time relatively split between second and shortstop in 2022. It seems St. Louis values his defense to the point of seeing him as their potential starting shortstop moving forward, and all signs point to the starting job being his in 2023. Moving his elite glove provides manager Oliver Marmol with a three-headed defensive monster of Arenado, Edman and Goldschmidt in the infield, with second base likely to be filled by fellow utility man Brendan Donovan or recent graduate Nolan Gorman. Combining this defense with scary speed, smart baserunning, and hard contact that generates lots of extra base hits creates an impressive profile. Edman may fly under the radar next to his MVP-level teammates, but dont be surprised to see him turn some heads if he continues this trajectory.

#**#74 - Brandon Lowe - Tampa Bay Rays [](/TB) - Second Baseman**

**Written by:** u/otatoptroy

Injuries ruined Lowes 2022 season, as he played in just 65 games and was clearly diminished at the plate. When hes at full strength theres no doubt Lowe is one of the leagues top second basemen, as he blasted 39 home runs and posted a 137 wRC+ in 2021, his last full season. Lowe has been the engine of the Tampa Bay offense since their 2020 World Series appearance and a return to form would be significant for the clubs success this year.

#**#73 - Joe Musgrove - San Diego Padres [](/SD) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/otatoptroy

The Padres, in their biggest game of the season to that point, turned to Musgrove for an elimination Game 3 of the Wild Card Series during their October playoff run. Facing a Mets lineup that was one of the best in all of baseball, on the road nonetheless, Musgrove proceeded to pitch a game so nasty that the Mets thought he had to be cheating -- [demanding the umpires to check his ears for a foreign substance](https://twitter.com/timandfriends/status/1579274998950281216). Musgrove was clean, of course, and San Diego advanced on the back of his 7 inning, one hit performance.  

Musgrove added his first All-Star Game nomination in 2022 to his list of accomplishments that include pitching a no-hitter in 2021 and a World Series ring with Houston in 2017. In August the Padres wisely locked him up for the next five years on a $100 million deal.

#**#72 - Matt Olson - Atlanta Braves [](/ATL) - First Baseman**

**Written by:** /u/FederalLeagueMVP

The prodigal Matt returned home to Georgia earlier this year, going from Oakland to Atlanta in a blockbuster trade. Lets get the negatives out of the way- yes, he's the slowest player in baseball and his once-incredible defense has dulled since his OAA peak in 2019. After a dismal '20 season, Olson put forth one helluva comeback in '21, posting 5+ fWAR. In comparison, his '22 campaign may seem a bit more depressing (3.1 fWAR) but not to fear. Olson still clung on to a +10% BB rate, improved his hard hit% into the highest tier of hitters, and finished top 15 in barrels.

His batting eye is superb, his power awe-inspiring. Not to mention, for a brief time at the start of the summer he held the active consecutive games played streak. If the previous two years have shown the baseball world anything, it's to not count out Matt Olson and his ability to improve and elevate his game at the plate to awesome levels.

#**#71 - Yu Darvish - San Diego Padres [](/SD) - Right-Handed Pitcher**

**Written by:** u/SeeYaLaterDylan

Few players are more visually satisfying to watch than Darvish, who takes advantage of six-plus pitches to dice up batters. Fortunately for San Diego, Darvishs continued artistry came with a rebound in results in 2022, as he pitched to a 3.10 ERA over 194.2 innings in his second year with the Padres. The strikeouts ticked down a little bit, understandable considering he was in his age-35 season, but his control and contact prevention were as good as theyve ever been.


The keys for Darvish going forward will be if he can maintain the quality of his stuff through his late 30s and his reliable innings production, having staved away lengthy time on the injured list over the past four seasons. Darvish has exhibited enough creativity and adaptability that should solidify him as one of the Padres' rotation aces in what could be one of the biggest seasons in franchise history.","baseball",35,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/109i6mc/rbaseball_top_100_players_for_the_2023_season_8071/"

Matt Garza is a good example of the prototypical One Left Off I have in my head: a guy who, despite never really being one of the premier players at his position, was nevertheless good enough to stick around. He did stuff worth remembering, for sure, but he finished his career without ever entering an upper echelon of pitchers. This is a description that is worthy of taking pride in. Sure, nobody grows up thinking ""I want to be a middle-of-the-road team's third starter,"" but somebody's gotta be that guy, and when that guy does as well as Matt Garza did, it's noteworthy. While those people don't generally appear on the Hall of Fame ballot, teams will still call you up and give you millions of dollars to do that for them. And so now we can talk about the teams that he did that for.

Out of high school, Garza was picked 1191st overall in the 2002 MLB Draft. He wanted that number to be different, so after a couple years at Fresno State, his junior year made the number lower and the signing bonus higher. The Twins picked him 25th overall in 2005, and $1.35 million later, he started pitching for them. If you blinked, you missed his time in the minors. After 2005 was spent working his mechanics out with the midlevel-A Beloit Snappers, 2006 was spent completely disregarding every level that wasn't the Majors. 14-4 across high-A, double-A, and triple-A, striking out 154 while walking just 32, and making it all the way to the big leagues just over a year after getting drafted. On August 11th, 2006, 424 days after he'd signed with Minnesota, Matt Garza made his Major League debut with the Twins. As that day's starting pitcher. Against a Toronto Blue Jays squad that were hungry to make it back to the postseason after over a decade. And it was made very clear to him almost immediately that things were going to be different in the bigs. After getting just eight outs, Garza was pulled. He'd struck out two of the first three batters he'd faced, but had also allowed seven Blue Jays to touch home, two of which had hit home runs off him. And those two were Reed Johnson and John McDonald, who were, to put it lightly, not home run hitters, and to put it heavily, combined for 93 career home runs in over 2400 games played. Woulda been 91 if somebody else started that day. The Twins, who had slotted Garza in as their replacement for the injured Francisco Liriano, rode him through the end of the year as a rotation member, and I can only assume crossed their fingers that every other aspect of the team would click enough for them to reach the postseason. Even though Garza finished the year at 3-6 in 10 games, he hadn't actually done all that bad if you take out his first game. A 5.76 ERA turns into 4.75, FIP goes from 4.57 to 4.06, and a 1.700 WHIP becomes 1.585. Not amazing, but definitely not bad for a guy who wasn't a professional a year and a half ago. Also the Twins won 96 games and went to the playoffs, but because it was the Twins, they got swept in the ALDS and Matt Garza didn't pitch at all, so we can skip to 2007. Everybody is realizing this Garza kid did pretty well last year. Guy was named an All-Star at both high-A and double-A, pitched in the Futures Game, got named Minor League Player of the Year, and was only 23? Were I a baseball publication who did a prospect list, that guy would very likely show up near the top! The Twins decided to let him cook a bit longer in the minors to smooth out any wrinkles that had formed from his previous introduction to the Majors. Besides, they were already awash with pitching talent at the Major League level on account of that Johan Santana guy is pretty good, plus the Liriano dude I mentioned earlier, and also Scott Baker and Boof Bonser and- you get the picture. They weren't gonna be worse off giving him a few more practice reps. Garza's time with the Rochester Red Wings didn't blow the doors off like it had the previous year, but he did well enough. The Twins, on the other hand, did not do well enough. They were having some turnover in the rotation, with Ramon Ortiz and Sidney Ponson pitching themselves out of their spots. Then Kevin Slowey, the guy who filled that spot and just so happened to have been picked the round after Garza, got hurt in July. Minnesota figured that if they wanted to stay competitive, they had to take a chance, and Garza came back up. His first start in '07 was a far cry from what it had been in '06, tossing six shutout innings against the White Sox to help the Twins to a 12-0 win. 14 starts later, he'd shown he was no longer fearful of Major League bats. Six Quality starts, 67 strikeouts in 83 innings, ERA of 3.69, and a FIP of 4.18. His record of 5-7 more or less mirrored the struggles of his team who finished 79-83. After passing his rookie limits, Matt Garza had officially arrived. It was time for the rest of the league to bear witness to what he could do. And the Minnesota Twins were going to be here for it.

When I say the Twins would be here for it, I mean they'd have to read about it in the papers, because that offseason, Matt Garza got traded. Packaged with shortstop Jason Bartlett and minor league reliever Eddie Morlan, he got shipped to Tampa Bay for infielder Brendan Harris, outfielder Jason Pridie, and the meat of this deal, prospect extraordinaire Delmon Young. Looking at the trade now, it made sense for both sides. Garza was a highly touted pitching prospect, and while Tampa Bay had a great offense in '07, they'd allowed 944 runs to score on them, which you can't do if you wanted to win baseball games. The Twins, who had so much young pitching they didn't know what to do with it, scored the third fewest runs in the league, so needed a bat like Young to hopefully energize the lineup. The other parts of this trade made sense through that lens as well, with the exchange of Bartlett and Harris being seen as defense for offense. It could be safely expected that the Tampa Bay Rays, who dropped the Devil from their name before Garza's first season with them, would have a better year in 2008 than they had in 2007. This was not a high bar to clear. It should not be difficult to improve on a 96-loss season. That is, unless you were the Rays, who would be playing their 11th season in '08 and had yet to finish a year with more than 70 wins. And then, out of nowhere, they not only set a new franchise record for wins, that record was now *97*. How did that happen? Well, the refocus to defense definitely helped. Jason Bartlett, Gold Glove winner Carlos Pena, and AL Rookie of the Year Evan Longoria held down the infield while speedy outfielders Carl Crawford and B.J. Upton (when he felt like it) gobbled up fly balls. The offense remained consistently good, with Pena clubbing 31 homers, Longoria adding 27 of his own, and Upton, Crawford, and Bartlett combining for 85 stolen bases. And then there was the pitching. With a much better defense, the guys who took the mound for Tampa Bay locked it down. James Shields turned into Big Game James. Scott Kazmir was an All-Star. And that shiny new toy the team got in the offseason did really well too. Apart from a two-week break in April, Matt Garza spent the entire year in the rotation, and the numbers he put up backed it up. 11-9, 3.70 ERA, 128 strikeouts, and a 1.240 WHIP. He also tied for the league lead with two shutouts, accomplished within a couple weeks of one another. Add onto that another faceoff against the Marlins where he pitched all nine innings and allowed just one hit, a home run to Hanley Ramirez in the seventh inning. Garza's 3.4 bWAR was 5th best on the team. A team that, by the way, was going to the playoffs. And this time, Garza would be pitching in them. He started Game 3 of the Division Series against the White Sox, and was met with roughly the same situation he faced when he became a big leaguer for the first time: the kind of baseball he was now playing was a completely different beast from the one he'd become accustomed to. He made it through six innings, but due to some undue times for missed pitches, when he left the mound his team was in a 5-1 hole. The game would end 5-3, and Garza was saddled with the loss, which I doubt he was too torn up about on account of the Rays won Game 4 and advanced to play in the ALCS. Even though his loss likely didn't rattle him, it sure seemed to flip a switch. Because the Matt Garza that showed up in the American League Championship Series was a different beast.

Monday, October 13th, 2008. Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. The series is tied 1-1 after Daisuke Matsuzaka dealt 7 innings of zeroes for the Sox in Game 1 and B.J. Upton's sac fly in the bottom of the 11th ended Game 2 in favor of the Rays. On the mound for Boston, Jon Lester. Relatively unheralded before this year, the 24-year-old Lester arrived on the scene with a no-hitter in May and who likely would've gotten Cy Young votes had Dice-K not overshadowed him. On the other side, Tampa Bay's fellow 24-year-old Matt Garza. The game got away from Lester relatively early, with Upton knocking a three-run homer and Evan Longoria adding another one before the third inning was over. Garza, meanwhile, was cruising. After some danger in the second inning was evaded, he didn't allow a single Boston batter past first base through the end of the sixth inning. Even though he took one earned run on the day, not too many people care when the score is 9-1 instead of 9-0. Six innings, six hits, three walks, five strikeouts, one earned run. Not bad when you're facing the third best offense in the MLB and eventual MVP Dustin Pedroia. Following a Game 4 that ended 13-4 in favor of Tampa Bay, the Rays looked poised to cruise to their first ever World Series appearance the same year they had their first winning season. But then they blew a seventh inning 7-0 lead in Game 5 to lose on a walkoff J.D. Drew RBI single. Then they saw Josh Beckett and the Sox bullpen outduel James Shields and the Rays bullpen for a 4-2 Boston win in Game 6. All of a sudden, it was Game 7 time. And Lester and Garza were set to face off once again. Garza was immediately in the hole after surrendering a home run to who else but Pedroia, but once that was out of his system, he locked down the rest of the game. 1-2-3 second inning. Only blemish on the third inning was a definitely-not-payback HBP to Pedroia, but he struck out David Ortiz right after. Top of the fourth was another 1-2-3 outing, and a Longo RBI double tied it up in the bottom. Next up, Garza induced a Coco Crisp groundout, walked Pedroia after an 11-pitch battle, and forced a GIDP from Big Papi to keep the game tied. Rays took the lead in the bottom frame on a Rocco Baldelli single that scored Willy Aybar. Garza took his foot off the gas a bit and allowed runners at first and second with one out, but got Mark Kotsay to fly out and Jason Varitek to swing past strike three to keep the game in Tampa Bay's favor. Aybar added some cushion with a homer to lead off the bottom of the 7th, and after Boston's Alex Cora reached on an error to start off the top of the eighth, Garza's magnificent day was over. six outs and four Rays relievers later, Tampa Bay was going to the World Series. Garza's seven innings in Game 7 featured nine strikeouts, two hits, three walks, one earned run, and the win. And, because anything less may very well have meant the other team won the AL Pennant, he was given the ALCS MVP Award. His performance for the series amounted to a 2-0 record, 14 strikeouts in 13 innings, a 1.38 ERA, and a Championship Win Percentage Added of 17.06%, by far the highest of any Rays player. It would not be a stretch to say Matt Garza put the Tampa Bay Rays into the World Series. Sure, he kinda sucked in his lone start in the Fall Classic, allowing four earned runs and giving up three long balls, but he would not have had that start but for his two prior. And though the Rays fell in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series, they were a young team. Of the players who appeared in the Series, platoon DH member Cliff Floyd and bullpen guys Chad Bradford and Trever Miller were the only Rays over thirty years of age. They could very easily run this back. And Matt Garza, along with everyone else, could get another shot at a title.

The next two years, Matt Garza had more than a few games where he utterly dominated. In a game against Boston in April of '09, he didn't allow a baserunner through six innings, and called it a day after 7.2 innings of one-hit, one-walk, ten strikeout ball since his team was already winning 8-0. Pitched eight innings in a Phillies rematch and allowed a single run off a Jayson Werth homer. He went toe-to-toe for nine innings with this fella named Roy Halladay and got the dub after his team scored two runs in the 10th to win 4-2. He kicked off 2010 with three straight eight-inning showings, earning the win in all of them and allowing just two earned runs throughout. And then, of course, on July 26, 2010, Matt Garza had the best game of his life. Facing a Detroit Tigers lineup that boasted Johnny Damon, Austin Jackson, and Miguel Cabrera, Garza proceeded to face 27 batters, and achieved six strikeouts, one walk, and no hits. To date, he is the only person to throw a no-hitter in a Tampa Bay Rays uniform. And as if that wasn't enough, his team won 96 games that year. After a nasty hand dealt to the '09 Rays where they had an electric offense but finished 84-78 and 4th in the AL East, they decided to win more games and finished atop the division in 2010. Garza's contributions to both teams were, even with his singular games of heroism, in line with what you'd expect from a mid-rotation starter. 23-22, 3.93 ERA, 4.29 FIP, 339 Ks in 407.2 innings, and 1.256 WHIP. Garza had an issue with allowing home runs, piling up 53 long balls served up to batters across the two seasons. That was the 9th most among regular starters. And when he gave one up, it was likely Tampa Bay weren't gonna win that day. The Rays, incidentally, got bounced by the Rangers in the ALDS in 2010, and Matt Garza was in need of a payday. His total salary for 2011, thanks to arbitration, was set to be $5.95 million. That would have made him the highest paid Ray on the roster. Stu Sternberg would never allow that. So out went Garza, along with Fernando Perez and Zac Rosscup, to the Chicago Cubs. The package Tampa Bay got in return actually wound up really good, with Chris Archer, Robinson Chirinos, Sam Fuld, and Brandon Guyer all coming back in this trade. One of the reasons the Delmon Young trade tree is still going strong. But we're not talking about any of those guys. We're talking about Matt Garza. And he's a Chicago Cub now.

I know I said something to the effect of ""Matt Garza was never an amazing starting pitcher,"" and while that may still have been true in 2011 while he was a Cub, he was definitely top of the rotation material. There were a couple reasons for this. First, he got the home runs under control, allowing just 14 of them in 198 innings pitched. His HR/9 was 10th best in the NL that year, and sure helped to bring his FIP down to 2.95, which was 8th best in the entire MLB. Second, he decided to forego one great game among several average ones, and tossed more consistently good games. Of the 31 starts he had that year, 22 were Quality Starts, an all-time best for Garza. Third and finally, he played on a bad team. By more traditional stats, his season wasn't *amazing*, but was still very good. 10-10 with a 3.32 ERA and 1.258 WHIP were right around par for the course when it came to Garza the past couple years, and while he did set a career high in strikeouts with 197, it wasn't a super crazy jump from the 189 it had been previously. But on the 2011 Chicago Cubs? A team that fired their General Manager midseason because they'd already lost 60 games and it was July? Incredible. His 2.7 bWAR and 4.7 fWAR were both far beyond what anybody else in the rotation was doing. And his agent made sure the Cubs knew how well he was playing the next time they got around to giving him a contract. Garza's $9.5 million price tag was third most on the team in 2012, behind only franchise mainstays Alfonso Soriano and Ryan Dempster. But the top of the rotation stuff would falter, as all three of the things that were in his favor in 2011 went backward in 2012. First, he went from 14 homers allowed all year to 15 homers allowed by the All-Star break. Second, he went back to the old system of getting hot for a game or two then getting very not for the next fe. He got the best of Zack Greinke and the Brewers in his second start of the year with 8.2 innings of 3-hit, 2-walk, 9-strikeout pitching, delivered 7 innings of 1-hit, 1-walk, 10-strikeout stuff against a Phillies that won 102 games the previous year, then watched the Cubs lose all seven of his subsequent decisions. Which ties into the third thing, this Chicago team was even worse than the last one. So bad, in fact, that by the trade deadline, they were one of just two teams who had yet to score 400 runs. And to add insult to injury, after it passed, they would no longer have access to two of their more capable rotation arms. Ryan Dempster had been too good for the team to keep him, and got traded to the Boston Red Sox. And Matt Garza, as luck would have it, was on the DL with stiffness in his throwing arm that turned into elbow trouble, eventually cutting his season short at just 18 starts. The Cubs, who had only lost 59 games at that point thanks in part to some gargantuan efforts from the pitching department, completely bottomed out and finished with 101 losses. Garza wouldn't return to the 25-man roster until mid-May the next year, but unleashed all the good games he'd been bottling up back-to-back-to-back, with five starts in a row that went 7+ innings with 1 or fewer earned runs. Apparently somebody told him that these Chicago Cubs had a similar plan to the previous year's, where they'd be okay up until the trade deadline then disappear and lose a bajillion games. And his response was to pull a Ryan Dempster and be too good not to trade. 11 starts, a 6-1 record, a 3.17 ERA, and 62 strikeouts in 71 innings later, the Rangers called and made an offer with a bunch of young talent. The Cubs sent Matt Garza to Texas for Justin Grimm, Mike Olt, Carl Edwards Jr., and Neil Ramirez, and after getting putting on a Rangers jersey he realized he'd used up all his good games in Chicago. While he started strong with a 7.1 inning 1-unearned run performance against the Yankees, and finished strong with a 8-inning 1-earned run game against the Royals, everything in between was very meh. From 6 Quality Starts in his final 6 starts as a Cub to just 4 in 13 games started as a Ranger. Worst part, the team he went to didn't even make the playoffs. After a Game 163 was necessary to decide who between the Rangers and the Rays (oh hey how have you been) would be the second AL Wild Card team, Garza had to watch his old teammate David Price, who had closed out his Game 7 ALCS victory all those years ago, pitch a complete game victory to send Garza's team home. And just like that, he was a free agent. Garza had just had a year split between two teams that went... honestly pretty well, all things considered. 10-6, 3.82 ERA, 136 strikeouts in 155.1 innings, and all that in his age-29 season. This was something more than a couple teams would pay big money for if he could do it consistently for them. So who would?

The 2013-14 MLB free agent class was an interesting one. There were definitely big fish out there, like Robinson Cano and Jacoby Ellsbury, but on the pitching front, it was a mishmash. Most of the pitching was guys who had done pretty well, but were on the older side. Bronson Arroyo, Hiroki Kuroda, Bartolo Colon, A.J. Burnett, Tim Hudson, heck even Joe Nathan, were all free agents who had pitched very well in recent years, but were also all over 35. Besides them, there were guys who had proven track records but hadn't been super great lately (e.g. Josh Johnson), guys who had had a nice 2013 but hadn't been all that good before then (e.g. Scott Feldman), and, of course, the great Japanese mystery box Masahiro Tanaka. Only a couple pitchers were still considered young-ish, had a history of being good, were still good, and were free agents. Among that select few were Ervin Santana, Ubaldo Jimenez, and MLB Trade Rumors's 7th best free agent and 3rd best starting pitcher, Matthew Scott Garza. And the Milwaukee Brewers, who looked poised to really bounce back after a 74-win 2013, decided to pull the trigger on him, handing over a 4-year, $52 million contract with a fifth year Vesting Option. The Brew Crew had been very limited the previous season with injuries to sluggers Ryan Braun and Aramis Ramirez. Both would have full seasons to lay the hurt on in 2014. And after twelve different pitchers had started a game for Milwaukee in 2013, they looked to Matt Garza to lower that number in 2014. And by the end of June, everything appeared to be going according to plan. Braun and Ramirez were back, catcher Jonathan Lucroy and center fielder Carlos Gomez looked downright amazing, outfielder Khris Davis and second baseman Scooter Gennett were having very good first full seasons, and the team was atop the National League with a 51-33 record. The bullpen that featured Will Smith, Zack Duke, and K-Rod was firing on all cylinders. And the starting rotation was basically coasting off everything else. Don't get me wrong, they were quite good. Kyle Lohse had already won 9 games, and he, Wily Peralta, and Yovani Gallardo all featured ERA pluses over 110. But none of them could seriously be considered ""elite,"" best exemplified by Francisco Rodriguez being the only Brewers pitcher selected to the All-Star game that year. Speaking of the All-Star game, it happened in the middle of July, and when it took place, the Brewers had a record of 53-43. They went 2-10 to start off the month, and the starting pitchers took 7 of those 10 losses. Uh oh. Thankfully for them, they put those jitters in a box and forgot about them after the All-Star game, and were right back to 73-58 near the end of August. All they had to do was coast from here on out, and they'd be into the playoffs no problem. And then, over the next two weeks and change, Milwaukee suffered 14 losses in 15 games. 11 of those losses were suffered by the starters. In the blink of an eye, the Brewers went from 73-58 and all but locked into a playoff spot to 74-71 and hanging on to postseason hopes for dear life. They wouldn't make it, finishing the year 82-80 after a complete offensive implosion in the last third of their season. For Matt Garza's part, he did what he could, contributing an 8-8 record and 3.64 ERA in 27 starts, the best of which was a two-hit complete game shutout of the Cincinnati Reds. But it appears the collapse that the team suffered couldn't be exorcised over the ensuing winter. The next year, manager Ron Roenicke got fired just 25 games into the season, because his team had lost 18 of them. Craig Counsell took over, though there was nothing he could do but watch as the Brewers descended to the depths of 68-94. Matt Garza hobbled along to a 6-14 record with an ERA of 5.63 and the worst WHIP of his career at 1.567. Got to the point that he was shut down in late August because he was doing poorly and Milwaukee wanted to give some younger guys a chance. Talk about a blow to one's confidence. Injuries and suckitude plagued the last two years of his contract, and even as the Brewers improved around him, Garza was stuck in neutral. His combined stats for 2016 and 2017 aren't pretty. 12-17 in 41 starts, a 4.74 ERA, just 149 strikeouts to 81 walks and 28 homers in 216.1 innings. After not meeting the vesting option criteria, Garza cost the Milwaukee Brewers $52 million for four years that netted them -0.7 total bWAR. Back into free agency, a surgery would rule out his chances of appearing in the 2018 season, and after nobody called him for 2019, that was it. Matt Garza was done. Man, talk about a garbage way to end your career. Or should I say, Garza-ge? No I shouldn't. I'm sorry.

There are more than a couple scenarios where I can see Garza showing up on the ballot. If he'd absolutely killed it as a Brewer and hung around a couple more years, he likely would have a better career record, lower ERA, maybe an All-Star appearance or two, and if you combine that with the rest of his career, that could probably do it. But sadly, that didn't happen, and he got left off. But let the record show that he most certainly still left a mark while he was in the big leagues. He's one of only four guys to have pitched the only no-hitter in a team's history, he's got a League Championship Series MVP trophy in his cabinet, and even if he didn't end up living up to it, he did still sign a $50 million contract. Guy has stuff to be proud of, and even if he's not on the ballot, he doesn't need to be. 

Matt Garza would visit the Hall in a Rays cap for his ALCS MVP, no-hitter, 34 wins, and 8.5 bWAR with them. If Miggy's plaque is on display, he'd walk up to it and say ""still can't hit me,"" referring to the no-hitter, but also to the fact that Cabrera was 2-for-13 against Garza in his career, even if the first time they met he hit a home run.

Potential is a funny thing. It can turn a regular high school student who happens to be good at baseball into a multimillionaire. It can make sports teams of all kinds try to lose as many games as they can. It can also disappear without warning. Do not interpret this as an indictment of the career of one Geovany Soto. He was still above-average for the majority of his time playing baseball. But when people think of him now, the comparisons and the 'I thought he was gonna'-s start coming out, and I think that that framing is unfair. Soto had himself a perfectly fine time in the sun for what it was, and because of one really good year that just so happened to coincide with his rookie limits in the MLB expiring, people remember him as this one that got away. That's not who he was. He was just a catcher who played baseball his own way. What was his own way and how did his career playing baseball go? So glad you asked.

The journey of Geovany Soto's career began in 2001, when the Chicago Cubs selected him with their 11th round pick.After trying a couple positions on for size at the rookie league level, the Puerto Rican teen settled on catcher. This was a good decision, because while his hitting numbers would be considered pedestrian at pretty much any other position, they were a cut above your run-of-the-mill minor league catcher. And when you're a cut above something in the minors, you get promoted. Soto went from the rookie-level Arizona League in 2002 to the high-A Florida State League in 2003 to the double-A Southern League in 2004. Stats-wise, nothing really changed league to league. Soto's batting average would be above .250 but not by a whole lot, his OPS would be in the neighborhood of .750, he'd have some power though not an amazing amount, and he'd throw out about 30% of prospective base stealers. That consistent performance led him to a debut with the big boy Chicago Cubs after 91 games with AAA Iowa in 2005. It was just a cup of coffee in September that saw him get exactly one pinch-hitting appearance in a game that didn't matter, but that's more plate appearances than I got in my age-22 season. Soto's usual minors affair played out in 2006 when he was back in Iowa. He batted .272/.353/.386 for a .739 OPS, hit just 6 homers in 108 games, and threw out 37 of 130 potential bag swipers for a 28% clip. Cup of coffee number two was offered and accepted that September, but this time Soto got to start a couple games, even knocking in a couple runs and touching home plate himself, albeit in games that were even more meaningless. But then, in the winter of '06-'07, Soto decided he wanted more. He wanted to hit more home runs. And he wanted to be a regular MLB player. So in 2007, he ditched the hitting formula that had gotten him this far and went *off*. .353/.424/.652 in 110 games with 26 home runs, more than doubling his entire minor league career total. Not only did that earn him a spot at the All-Star Futures Game, it meant he got called up earlier in the season when Michael Barrett got traded away in June. Sure, he got sent down after just two games when the team acquired Jason Kendall, but the message was sent: the Cubs were interested. Soto only piqued that interest when he took his cup of coffee piping hot that year, gathering 20 hits with 6 doubles and 3 home runs in just 15 big league games. Chicago's interest was so piqued, that they decided Soto's 21st and 22nd career MLB starts at catcher would come in the National League Division Series. Sure, they got swept 3-0 by Arizona, but you know what Geovany Soto did? He hit a home run. And he was the only Cub to do so in that series. Now if that's not the best indication that this new look he's got going on is his new normal, I don't know what is. 2008 rolled on in, Jason Kendall was with Milwaukee now, and after spring training was over, the Cubs opened their season at Wrigley Field against who else but the Brewers. And batting 7th in the Chicago lineup was this catcher from Puerto Rico whose rookie status was still intact despite hitting a home run in the previous year's playoffs. It didn't matter that they lost in extra innings. Geovany Soto had arrived. And soon enough, everyone would know it.

Humans are funny. The reason that the ""correlation is not causation"" aphorism has so often been bandied about is because it is hardwired into our brains to assume the opposite. For example, if a team - we'll make one up and call it the Chicago Cubs - wins 85 games and barely scrapes into the playoffs one year, and the same team a year later wins 97 games, the most in the National League (another made up name), and becomes a juggernaut, people are gonna look for reasons that that happened. Now pretend that everything was actually real and happened in 2007 and 2008. What reasons can we point to for that improvement happening? One explanation is incremental changes. For some examples, Ryan Dempster getting promoted to the rotation and having a really good year, Mark DeRosa and Ryan Theriot improving their OPSes by over 50 points each, and a late-season push greatly assisted by twelve impeccably pitched games from deadline addition Rich Harden. Or, if you wanted to, you could see that the Cubs didn't have a very good catcher in 2007, but did in 2008, and attribute a whoooole lot of it to that. As the baseball world is wont to do, various people explained the Cubs' emergence as a powerhouse in '08 in their own way, but one thing was clear: Geovany Soto made this team better. And that season, he made this team better by being really good at baseball. Starting all but 31 of the team's games at catcher, Soto batted .285/.364/.504 for a 119 OPS+ with 23 homers and 86 RBIs. To get that kind of offense from a rookie was something. To get that kind of offense from a rookie catcher was something else entirely. Not since Mike Piazza a decade and a half prior had a rookie catcher done what Soto just did, and just like when it happened with Piazza, people noticed. Soto was given not one but two NL Rookie of the Month awards. He didn't just go to the All-Star game, he was the starting catcher for the National League, the first rookie to ever do that. He caught a Carlos Zambrano no-hitter. He finished 13th in NL Most Valuable Player voting, ahead of players like Tim Lincecum, Brandon Webb, and Johan Santana, who split all but one of the first-place votes for the NL Cy Young Award, with Lincecum actually winning the thing. Speaking of winning things, Geovany Soto went and won himself the 2008 National League Rookie of the Year Award, earning 31 of the 32 possible first-place votes. The 32nd one went to another player who had remarkably similar stats but played a much less demanding defensive position at first base, and was also on a team that lost 88 games and didn't go to the postseason. Speaking of the postseason, Chicago went there. They faced the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had only just won their division with a, 84-78 record, but also laid claim to one of the most explosive trade deadline acquisitions, Manny Ramirez. Manny joined forces with a sneaky good rotation and fellow very good young catcher Russell Martin to not just beat the Cubs, but sweep them. Of the 27 innings that were played, the Cubs led for just 3 of them. Even though the two teams had similar batting averages for the series, LA pushed people across the plate, and Chicago just didn't. Soto went cold, going 2-for-11 and leaving 6 runners stranded. His performance was par for the course for a Cubs team where everyone not named Mark DeRosa or Derrek Lee fell asleep at the plate. And that was all she wrote for the '08 Cubs. But teams like that don't just disappear. They'd be back. And Soto would, too.

Oops, I pushed fast-forward and it looks like when I pushed play the year was 2012. How did they do? Neither the Cubs nor Soto had been back. Well, did they at least make it close? The Cubs went from 97 wins in '08 to 83 wins in '09 to 75 in '10 to 71 in '11. Well. This is not a trajectory that puts you into playoff contention. Not to say those years were without intrigue. Randy Wells and Derrek Lee made the 2009 Cubs worth watching even as they went from the Wild Card bubble to 8th place in the NL in a bit over two months. After Lou Piniella got fired in 2010, Mike Quade scrounged together a 24-13 record to finish the year. And in 2011, this 21-year-old kid nobody had ever heard of a couple years ago named Starlin Castro went and led the league in hits. Through it all, the primary catcher for these Chicago Cubs had always been Geovany Soto. He'd gone from a Sophomore Slump in 2009 when he hit just .218/.321/.381 in 102 games, to a Junior Jolt in 2010 when he hit .280/.393/.497 which was arguably better than his rookie year, to a Senior Settlement in 2011 hitting .228/.310/.411 which was better than it looks since offense was way down across the league. All told, he earned 5.2 bWAR over those three seasons, which put him just outside the top 10 among catchers over that time. Turns out, Geovany Soto is not Mike Piazza. And sure, people who wanted him to be Mike Piazza were disappointed, but it's not like Chicago Cubs catcher Mike Piazza would've made this ballclub into a winning one. What was happening was that all the good Cubs were getting older, and the young Cubs weren't quite as good as the old ones had been. By 2012, Aramis Ramirez was gone, Derrek Lee was gone, Ted Lilly was gone, Carlos Zambrano was gone, and Chicago had made it very clear that their eyes were set on the future and not the present. The team had lost 52 games by the All-Star break, and come trade deadline day, set the dial to ""Sell! Sell! Sell!"" Paul Maholm and Reed Johnson went to Atlanta. Ryan Dempster became a Ranger in exchange for, among others, a prospect named Kyle Hendricks. And shortly before the final bell tolled and the deadline, Soto would also get traded to Texas. And here was where we might begin to see the word ""bust"" getting thrown out. Because - my goodness, I'm very sorry for the impropriety, I neglected to name the first baseman who came second to Soto in Rookie of the Year voting. His name was Joey Votto. And while Soto had been doing his best on a Cubs team fading from relevance, Votto had soared into the spotlight on a Cincinnati Reds team that was on the up and up. They would end 2012 winning 97 games, the same number the Cubs had won Soto's rookie year. Votto, despite missing 50 games with injury, would get as many MVP votes as Cy Young winner R.A. Dickey. I doubt Votto was too broken up about it on account of he'd already won an MVP in 2010. Meanwhile, Soto just got traded for Jake Brigham and cash. Who's Jake Brigham? Exactly. But none of that is important at the moment. Soto is a Ranger now. And he's got baseball to play.

Just a week and a half after Geovany Soto became a Ranger, regular catcher Mike Napoli strained his quad, and wouldn't catch another game for five weeks. Now who do you think covered for him during that interim? None other than Mike Pi... it was Soto. However, it was a different Soto than people had become accustomed to. You don't get traded for Who McWhatNow and a stack of bills if you're playing like a Rookie of the Year. And Soto most certainly was not. His .199/.284/.347 hitting line with Chicago was only passable because he was a catcher and because the Cubs weren't trying to win. The Rangers, on the other hand, were. And while he wasn't terrible, he wasn't exactly good either, hitting just .206/.264/.320 during his stint as primary catcher. But Texas won 19 of the 30 games he played in, so they didn't mind all that much. The Rangers finished the year with 93 wins, though since Soto only played in 47 of them and didn't do all that great, very few people ascribed that total to him this time. And those 93 wins were good enough to qualify for the playoffs. He was finally back. And he actually started the game! Wait, game? Yep, the Rangers played in the inaugural American League Wild Card game against the Baltimore Orioles, and lost 5-1. Soto only batted twice, striking out and grounding out before getting subbed out for Mitch Moreland. The Rangers became just the second team in the modern MLB to go home after making the playoffs and playing exactly one game. But because Soto hadn't done too bad as a backup, they decided to stick with him for 2013. Soto was wearing a new uniform and in a new role, but the goal was the same: win. And so, they did. The 2013 Rangers went 91-71. Thanks to some great hitting and fielding from guys like Adrian Beltre, Ian Kinsler, Craig Gentry, and Elvis Andrus, combined with good pitching out of Yu Darvish, Derek Holland, Joe Nathan, and a host of other names, they once again captured a Wild Card spot. Geovany Soto also contributed in his own way. While backing up A.J. Pierzynski, Soto only got into 54 games, but found time to hit 9 homers and accrue 1.5 bWAR. This was the closest he'd come to replicating 2008 since leaving Chicago. Could he keep it up for the playoffs? We'll have to... wait. The Tampa Bay Rays won 91 games too. Guess the Rangers would have to beat them in a Game 163. Sure hope Martin Perez doesn't allow a home run to Evan Longoria to put the game away early. Oh no. Ah well, guess they'd have to get 'em next year. Sure hope all the pitchers stay healthy and don't get injured. Hang on, *41 different pitchers*? Eek. Soto must've been really tired catching that many pitchers. Except a spring training knee injury took him out of commission for the first three months of the season, and an arrest for possession of marijuana meant that the comeback would be delayed even longer. Geovany Soto's first game in the Majors in 2014 was on July 18th. Over the next month, he only played 10 games, but they were all in service of a team that had known they were playing for next year. Ultimately, the decision was made by the Rangers to get something for Soto while they still could, so in late August, he was sold to the Oakland Athletics. With the A's backup catcher John Jaso out for the year and Soto due to be a free agent, they figured they didn't have anything to lose picking him up. And he wasn't half bad, batting .262/.354/.357 in 14 games for them. 10 of those games just so happened to end in an A's loss, because Soto joined Oakland in the midst of a significant month-long plunge from the best record in the American League to being the away team in the AL Wild Card Game. Soto actually started that game, but got subbed out after one plate appearance for Derek Norris, the regular A's starter who was also an All-Star that year. When Soto left, the score was 2-1 Oakland. It did not end that way. Soto would, once again, be on the losing end of a playoff game. And not too long after that, he'd be a free agent. Anybody want a backup catcher who was really good once?

The White Sox remembered seeing Geovany Soto all over town a few years back, and so picked him up for a year and $1.5 million in 2015. As a member of the White Sox, he served as the primary catcher for Jeff Samardzija, John Danks, and eventually Jose Quintana. The regular backstop, Tyler Flowers, caught everyone else. Samardzija, who threw to Soto, would go on to lead the league in Earned Runs Allowed, Hits Allowed, and Home Runs Allowed. Chris Sale, who threw to Flowers, would get MVP votes. Correlation is still not causation, but *oof*. Soto wasn't bad from beside the plate, though, playing in 78 games and batting .219/.301/.406 with 9 homers. Trust me, especially for a catcher, that was good for the time. Chicago finished under .500 on the year, a sentence Soto was acclimated with. They decided to start over with their catching situation, and bid farewell to Geovany at the end of the year. The Angels, who had just lost Chris Iannetta, gave him a call, and set him up as part of a platoon. He played well enough in his first several games to become the regular, a position he'd have for all of about two weeks before the knee problems from Texas acted up again. After going on the DL in late May, he'd only play in six more games for the Angels before the season was over. Round 2 with the White Sox started in 2017, and he did make quite the return with two home runs in his first game back, but elbow issues arose in May, and his season ended after just 13 games. Though he had the chance, he was never teammates with pitcher Giovanni Soto, which is honestly probably the most disappointing part of this whole thing for me. Almost as bad as when the A's acquired Brett Lawrie and traded away Jed Lowrie in the same offseason. Anyway, when an attempted comeback in 2019 fell on deaf ears, that was it for the career of Geovany Soto.

I started this shindig off by saying that potential is a funny thing. And potential is what I think kept Geovany Soto off this year's Hall of Fame ballot. Soto had the misfortune of debuting the same year as Joey Votto, and just a couple years before Buster Posey, who inadvertently tamped down his career achievements thanks to their continued brilliance after their rookie years. People thought he could be what they saw in him in 2008, and while there were definitely times that he was that guy after that year, they were too few and too far between for many people's likings. There comes an expectation when you win Rookie of the Year. That trophy in Geovany Soto's cabinet has history to it. But that history should not define his career. If he did not appear as an answer to the prayers of a longsuffering Cubs franchise, only to end up as a catcher who wasn't that bad, his career would be remembered very differently, likely even positively. And that is how I will choose to remember him.

Soto would visit the Hall of Fame in a Cubs hat because of course. If their schedules work, he might be able to go with 2009 NL Rookie of the Year Chris Coghlan. And depending on when they go, they might be able to visit the plaques of Votto and Posey (fingers crossed).

"2023-04-21",1682060898,"Rookie Weekly Analysis Week 2","# AL Front Runners:

**Hunter Brown (HOU P):** With Anythony Volpe and Masataka Yoshida starting the season off slow, Hunter Brown has appeared as the early front runner for AL Rookie of the year. Brown was shaken up in his first start. However, Brown quickly rebounded with two quality starts against the Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers. Brown has 1.93 ERA in 18.2 innings and has shown to be a quality starter for the defending World Series Champs (More details below).

**Josh Jung (TEX 3B):**: The Rangers third baseman has shown a strong glove in the hot corner. Jung leads rookies in hits with 19 with 3 doubles and three home runs. Jung downside has been a high strikeout rate having 20 striekouts on the season.

**Logan O'Hoppe (LAA C):** O'Hoppe has emerged as the starting catcher for the Los Angeles Angels. He is providing power in a position known for its defense batting .283/.339/.547 on the season. O'Hoppe has his first caught stealing of the season forcing Matt Champman into a rundown on early in April. Unfortunately, O'Hoppe may find some time on the injured list after injuring his shoulder on a base hit against the Yankees.

**Esteury Ruiz (OAK OF):** Ruiz, tied with Spencer Steer, leads rookies in batting average with a .302. The last two weeks Ruiz has 15 base hits and has swiped 5 bases. This centerfielder has quickly established himself as a consistent leadoff man for the As. Although he has not had much power in his bat, Ruiz will be an on-base threat to with the bigger bases and ban on the shift. Look for Ruiz to be a top base stealer in the majors this year because he stole 85 in the minors in 2022.

# NL Front Runners

**Corbin Carroll (AZ OF):**: The NL Rookie of the Year favorite has only impressed. He leads all rookies in at-bats and hits the ball hard. Carroll has improved his plate vision but has only taken 3 walks all season as opposed to his 18 strikeouts. Carroll has 7 steals on the season and has recently found more power in his swing. Carroll has a chance to achieve the reach the exclsuive 20-40 club this season with the new rule changes. (More Details Below in Weekly Performances)

**James Outman (LAD OF):** Outman leads all rookies with 15 RBI and home runs (5), and leads MLB with 3 triples. This 7th round draft pick has become the starting center fielder after the departure of Cody Bellinger. Outman is slashing a respectable .290/.397/.645 with 1 double. 3 triples, and 5 home runs. (More details below).
 
**Spencer Steer (CIN 1B):** The Reds have a new starting third baseman. Steer has batted a solid .302/.397/.497 in his first 16 games but missed some time due to knee and quad soreness. In his second stint in the majors, Steer has found more power in his abt hitting 4 doubles and 2 home runs. Steer seems to have a solid eye at the plate as well - having only 8 strikeouts to his 9 walks on the season. Steer also has the added benefit of being a highly versatile infielder with the ability to slot anywhere in the diamond.  

**Kodai Senga (NYM P):** Senga continues to impress despite early troubles keeping the ball in the park. Senga is 3-0 on the season with a 4.29 ERA in his first 4 starts. He has struck out 25 batters thanks to his ""ghost fork"". Despite his success on the mound, Senga has given up 18 hits, 10 ER, and 5 home runs including a 3 home run day against the Giants. Despite these struggles, Senga has been able to limit the damage and solidify himself as the wins leader among rookie pitchers.

**Jordan Walker (STL OF):** Jordan Walker on base streak came to an end after 12 games after going 0-3 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The 20 year old outfielder tied a 111-year-old record and continues to establish himself as a threat at the plate. Walker his slashing a .269/.310/.388 with 2 doubles and 2 home runs on the season. Walker has had some struggles defensively in the outfield, but this will likely improve as the former infielder gets more experience in the outfield.

# Best Weekly Performances

**Peyton Battenfield (CLE SP):** Battenfield made his major league debut against the Yankees on April 12th after Triston McKenzie and Aaron Civale landed on the IL. In his first two starts of the year, Battenfield has only allowed 2 ERs in 10.2 innings for Cleveland. Battenfield in his second start gave the Guardians a quality start going 6 innings with 1 earned run. Battenfield has a high whiff rate on his cutter. Battenfield is currently battling for the fifth starter position in the Guardian's rotation.

**Corbin Carroll (AZ OF):** In his first week in the majors, Carroll was an on-base presence. In the last two weeks, Carroll has found his power hitting 12 base hits with 2 doubles, 3 home runs, and four stolen bases. Carroll is an everyday starter for the Diamondbacks and living up to his preseason hype.

**James Outman (LAD OF):** Outman was on this list even before crushing my Cubs. Last two weeks, Outman has 14 base hits with 1 double, 1 triple, and 4 home runs. He has ten RBIs in the last 15 days and currently slashing .292/.370/.604 as an everyday starter for the Dodgers. Outman hit his first career [Grand Slam](https://www.mlb.com/news/james-outman-hits-go-ahead-grand-slam-in-dodgers-win) in the 9th against the Chicago Cubs and [threw out] Trey Mancini at home from Right Field.

**Hunter Brown (HOU P):** Brown has produced two quality starts against the Rangers and Twins. Brown pitched 7 innings against both, striking out 7 against the Twins and 5 against the Rangers. By going deeper into games than most starting pitchers, Brown is lengthening the availability of the Astro's bullpen while simultaneously providing quality outs.

"2022-11-11",1668196410,"Feeling Guilty....","So I am 34, lifelong g A's fan, grew up about an hour from Oakland. Now I live between LA and San Diego. I find myself losing interest in baseball as I watch The A's compete regularly but never hold onto any of their players and become a feeder team to the more expensive teams. Now with the possible move to Vegas and our salary being roughly the same as what Manny Machados contract is I find myself really struggling to keep interest. I can't even buy jerseys of my favorite players because I know in 2 yrs they'll be on another team. Giambi, Tejada, Gray, Chapman, Olson. The list goes on. 
Now that I live in SoCal I find myself with particular interest in Padre baseball. They haven't won anything yet so don't feel like a Dodger bandwagon guy. They're exciting to watch, great ballpark and look to compete every year not to mention I get sports talk on The Friars on the daily where Oakland is a little more difficult. Hell even bay area sports talk spends more time talking Giants. 
But as a HUGE sports fan I feel so guilty switching teams. It's actually (as stupid as it sounds) makes me feel guilty and like a fake fan. But baseball was my 1st love and I want to enjoy it again. Is it wrong to switch teams? 
It's not like Oakland has been bad for 2 decades. They compete almost yearly and have had many playoff season, more than SD in the last 10 years. But they never keep players so can't grow attached and show no ambition to spend ever so the offseason and hot stove is basically non existent for us. We just watch the minor leagues and hope for the best. 
Someone give me advice on what to do.","baseball",47,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/ysl332/feeling_guilty/"

It is week one, so let us overreact to performances by our newest players in the MLB. I personally struggle to keep up with all the new players every season, so I wanted to create a post showcasing players still with the rookie status.

# Notable Batting Performances

**Jordan Walker (STL RF)** \- Out of all Rookies, only Masataka Yoshido has more at bats than Jordan Walker and Walker is taking advantage of every at bat. Walker has accumulated two doubles, 5 RBIs, and his first [home run](https://www.mlb.com/video/jordan-walker-homers-1-on-a-line-drive-to-left-field) through his first six starts this season. 

**Garrett Mitchell (MIL CF)** - Held hitless his first two games, Garrett Mitchell has gotten hot in his last four games with 6 hits including his first [triple](https://www.mlb.com/video/garrett-mitchell-s-rbi-triple) of the year. Mitchell leads all rookie batters with 3 home runs and is currently slugging .850. Though Mitchell may be in hot water after crediting his [walk-off home run](https://www.mlb.com/video/garrett-mitchell-homers-3-on-a-fly-ball-to-right-center-field) to the absence of his wife.  

**Miguel Vargas (LAD 2B)** - With Gavin Lux out for the season, the door has opened for rookie Miguel Vargas to shine at second base. In his first three games of the season, Vargas walked 7 times. He currently leads the league in walks with 9 and OBP with .722. Through his patience at the plate, Vargas has accumulated 3 hits in 8 at bats with one double. However, Vargas is currently dealing with a thumb injury after taking a fastball to his right hand from Rockies reliever Connor Seabold.

**Logan O'Hoppe (LAA C)** - The Angel's catcher is currently slugging .667 on the season. O'Hoppe has slugged for two home runs and 8 RBIs through his first five games of the season. Playing a position primarily focused on defense, O'Hoppe is hoping to follow in the footsteps of Adley Rutschman and JT Realmuto as a feared slugging prsence. 

**Joey Wiemer (MIL RF)** - In his first Major League at-bat, Wiemer hits a double against the Chicago Cubs. In his first 17 at bats, Joey Wiemer has 6 hits and one stolen base. Wiemer made his MLB debut this year on April 1, 2023 against the Chicago Cubs after Luis Urias suffered a hamstring injury. Wiemer proceeded to hit his first [Major League home run](https://www.mlb.com/video/joey-wiemer-homers-1-on-a-fly-ball-to-right-center-field-jesse-winker-sco) against the New York Mets on April 5th. 

**Brice Turang (MIL 2B)** - The Brewers are hogging all the rookies this season. For his first MLB home run, Brice Turang hits a [Grand Slam](https://www.mlb.com/video/brice-turang-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-right-center-field-rowdy-tellez-score) against the New York Mets. Brice Turang made his MLB debut March 30, 2023 against the Chicago Cubs. Turang has 5 hits in 16 at-bats and 2 stolen bases through his first 6 games as the Brewers starting first baseman. 

**Josh Jung (TEX 3B)** - The rookie third baseman has slugged for .636 with two home runs and a double. Josh Jung hit a [go-ahead 2-run home run](https://www.mlb.com/video/josh-jung-homers-2-on-a-fly-ball-to-right-center-field-adolis-garcia-scor) against the Baltimore Orioles to help improve the Ranger's record to 4-2 on the season.

# Notable Pitching Performances

**Jhony Brito (NYY P)** -  In a week in which rookie starters struggled, Jhony Brito is the only one not to give up a run. Brito made his Major League debut on April 2nd, 2023 against the San Francisco Giants. Brito struck out six, gave up only 2 hits and 1 walk. Despite his strong performance, the right hander was optioned to Triple-A Scranton on to make room for reliver Ian Hamilton.

**Kodai Senga (NYM P)** - Japanese superstar, Kodai Senga, made his MLB debut on April 2nd, 2023. Senga did anything but disappoint. Senga pitched 5.1 innings and strikeout 8 batters in his debut against the Miami Marlins. All eight strikeouts came off Senga's 'ghost fork'. Senga began the game by allowing the first four batters to reach base. The only run came off Jorge Soler's double to right field. Senga quickly settled down to notch his first win of the season.

**Dylan Dodd (ATL P)** - Dodd made his MLB debut April 4th, 2023 against the St. Louis Cardinals after the Braves suffered injuries to Ian Anderson, Max Fried, and Michael Soroka. Although Dodd gave up 6 hits and a lot of hard contact, he allowed only one run through 5 innings. Dodd struck out 3 and issued no walks.

**Summary:**

Just 4 games under .500, the Tigers all of a sudden have a reason for optimism, as they are done with the AL East until just before the All-Star break, and in general they are through the toughest part of their schedule. Next, they'll head to St. Louis with an opportunity to kick the Cardinals while they are down.

Eric Haase this series - 5 for 11, 2 HR, 1 2B, 6 RBI, 3 R. Javy Baez this series - hit his 1st &amp; 2nd HRs of the season.

The Mets fall to 16-16 on the season and will need Max Scherzer to be much better in future starts if they hope to get back on the right track. After starting out the season hot, they've won just 2 of their last 11 games. The good news is that their schedule also gets much easier - they'll host the Rockies for 3 games next, and then they're on to Cincinatti.","baseball",435,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/137x4am/post_series_thread_the_detroit_tigers_sweep_the/"

"2023-10-09",1696863338,"PSA: The purpose of the playoffs is different than the regular season","There have been a number of posts and proposals recently here trying to ""fix"" the postseason format.  Typically, these proposals revolve around the idea that teams with better regular-season records are being insufficiently rewarded, and the opportunity for ""worse"" teams to advance is a flaw in the system.

I would like to suggest that this view is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the playoffs can and should be.

The purpose of the postseason is not to scientifically and statistically determine the best team of the year. *We already know that.*  One thing that baseball is *not* lacking is raw data, and every year the league plays exactly 2,430 games to allow us to determine who is statistically the best team over the course of the season.  This year, it was Atlanta. The large sample size of the 162-game schedule means that the regular season standings are a much more accurate gauge of ""true talent"" than the playoff results, especially now with the new balanced scheduled. 

If your priority is simply to know which team was best-constructed for a season of baseball, you don't need to even watch the postseason.  We already know. 

The postseason is measuring something quite different; specifically, which of these teams can ""get hot"" at the right time, and succeed in an ultra-high-pressure environment.  Sometimes this is the same as the ""true talent"" best team -- and other times, it's not.  If you want to make the argument that we should place more importance on the regular season results than the playoff results, I don't necessarily disagree, but just realize *they are measuring different things.* 

We can argue about 3-game versus 5-game series, etc., but at the end of the day, *no playoff format can ever be a statistically accurate way to rank team strength when compared to the regular season.*  

So, if you primarily care about which team is statically the best, just follow the pennant races, and switch over to football for October!  That's allowed!  If you want to enjoy the postseason, lean into the idea that chaotic results will happen, teams with inferior regular season records will sometimes defeat favorites, and all of that is by design.

"2022-11-07",1667827760,"What if each team rebranded to better reflect their home city/state?","Because the Cleveland Guardians rebranded to something that represents their hometown, I thought itd be fun to do that with every MLB team. I did way too much research for this, and I learned a ton of new random facts that I can bore my friends with later, but Im gonna start with the AL East.

## AL East:

**Baltimore Orioles**: A harbor city right in the middle of the east coast. Many people arent aware that the famed poet Edgar Allen Poe lived and died here which I think is pretty cool. While the oriole is the state bird of Maryland and has a long history as the name of a baseball team (Babe Ruth played for the minor league team for a bit), I think that honoring the late, great poet is perfect for the city. And in keeping with the bird theme, the **Baltimore Ravens** is a perfect name!

**Boston Red Sox:** While this is a classic, it doesnt really encapsulate the history of the city; a history where the start of the American Revolution happened. Therefore, the most fitting name would be the **Boston Patriots**.

**New York Yankees:** New York is a difficult one because theres just so much stuff to think about when coming up with names that fit the city. BUT! One of the first organized baseball teams did start in New York, and I think it would be great to pay homage to this history by taking the name of the **New York Knickerbockers** (New York Knicks for short).

**Toronto Blue Jays:** Since Toronto is the only Canadian team at the moment, the team name needs to represent all of Canada, and since Canada is a large and diverse country, were just gonna take after the flag and use the maple leaf. And for you grammar nerds out there, since this is a symbol, the team name would be spelled **Toronto Maple Leafs** (not leaves).

**Tampa Bay Rays:** Rays is a solid name for a Florida-based team, both in reference to the stingray and the rays of sunshine. But, alas, the rules dictate that we must change it. Also, as I was doing research for this, I realized how out-of-place the Pittsburgh Pirates name is. Last time I checked, pirates didnt sail that far inland, and pirates do have more of a history in Florida than in western Pennsylvania. Because of this, I wanted to rename them to the Tampa Bay Pirates, but I feel like this goes against the nature of this game to just re-use existing names, so were going to crack open the thesaurus and land on **Tampa Bay Buccaneers**.

## AL Central:

**Chicago White Sox**: With Cleveland changing their name from the Indians to the Guardians (fair), I do think this is just another example of the erasure of the American Indian in our sports culture, so I want to honor them in a proper way. While researching Chicago, I came across the famous chief Black Hawk who was a pretty badass dude who also published the [first Native American biography in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_(Sauk_leader)). Also there are helicopters of the same name (same origin) and thats always cool. After learning this, the White Sox were an easy rebrand to the **Chicago Blackhawks**.

**Cleveland Guardians:** Do I even need to come up with a new name here? They just changed it. Screw it, name them the Cavaliers or something dumb like that.

**Detroit Tigers:** Ive been to Detroit and I didnt see a single tiger. In fact, it was way too cold for any of the large jungle cats. Since Detroit was known for its car industry, I think its fitting to rename them to the **Detroit Pistons.**

**Kansas City Royals:** So the Royals are actually a great name with a [cool origin](https://www.mlb.com/news/kansas-city-royals-team-name-origin#:~:text=How%20they%20came%20to%20be%20called%20the%20Royals,-December%201st%2C%202021&amp;text=KANSAS%20CITY%20%2D%2D%20While%20many,heritage%20in%20the%20livestock%20industry.) from the livestock show, [the American Royal](https://www.americanroyal.com/), thats held in KC. But I really do believe that we need to increase the recognition of the American Indians, especially in the midwestern plains. To jump off from royal, the leaders of the native tribes were called chiefs so it should be easy to rebrand the Royals to the **Kansas City Chiefs**.

**Minnesota Twins:** Although the Twins name comes from the Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, another interesting factoid is that there is large Scandinavian history and culture there. And what better way of paying tribute to this culture than with the name of the **Minnesota Vikings**.

## AL West:

**Houston Astros:** As we are all aware, Houston has a huge space program. In fact, Yordon Alvarez was the last one to send a [projectile into orbit from Houston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxtVipOeBI) (Phillies fans dont click), so in the same vein, lets go with the **Houston Rockets**.

**Los Angeles Angels:** Translating to The The Angels Angels, I think we can all agree this name is pretty lazy. So Im going to be equally lazy and go with the **Los Angeles Kings** or something because thats what Hollywood thinks of themselves.

**Oakland As:** In preparation for the As moving to Vegas in the next couple years (we all know itll happen), a rebrand is on-point. When I think of Vegas, I think of the night life that it has to offer: The casinos, the Vegas Strip, the shows, etc. So the Las Vegas Nights was my first thought, but thats kind of stupid. Luckily, Knights sounds a lot like Nights, so lets go with that. Side note, did you know that Nevada is the [largest producer of gold in the US?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining_in_Nevada) To pay homage to this, the new name is the **Las Vegas Golden Knights.**

**Seattle Mariners:** The Mariners are a solid name for the port city of Seattle, so Im continuing the theme of seafarers but moving from the water to the air because you cant hit homeruns in the water. The new name Im choosing is the **Seattle Seahawks.**

**Texas Rangers:** While *Walker, Texas Ranger* is a great origin for a name (this is my head cannon, I will hear no arguments to the contrary), I think another equally quality name would be the Cowboys since Texas has a long history of cowboys. Might as well move them back to Dallas and call them the **Dallas Cowboys**.

## NL East:

**Atlanta Braves:** A borderline problematic name even though the team [has a pretty decent relationship with the Cherokees](https://www.11alive.com/article/sports/mlb/atlanta-braves/north-carolina-tribe-protects-braves-from-name-backlash/85-09749d40-81ea-43ee-b9df-8ff8fca5f698) to their lovely neighbors to the north, I know some of you would love to see a name change here too. I was initially thinking of the Atlanta Flames because of [Sherman's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea) in which he burned Atlanta to the ground, but Ive met people from Georgia and South Carolina, and as much as I think that would be hilarious, they are a contentious people who dont. Instead Im going with their state bird, the **Atlanta Thrashers**.

**Miami Marlins:** I guess Florida would have a pretty solid fishing industry, so Marlins does make sense, but every time Ive been to Miami, its been hot as balls. Im just gonna go with the **Miami Heat.** Also kinda has a nice ring to it.

**New York Mets:** For those of you who havent been to New York, the Mets ballpark is right by Laguardia Airport and planes are super cool. But whats even cooler than planes are jets. This one is an easy rebrand: the Mets to the **New York Jets**.

**Philadelphia Phillies:** Another historic city that was important to the American Revolution, and where the Declaration of Independence was signed back in 1776. To honor (without the u) our collective fuck you to the Bri\*ish, Im renaming them to the **Philadelphia 76ers**.

**Washington Nationals:** This one is an easy one, and it would help reduce the redundancy of having the Nationals in the National League. Since D.C. is the capital city of the US of A, the new name is now the  **Washington Capitals**.

## NL Central:

**Chicago Cubs:** The Cubs have been around for almost 150 years. I feel like they should be grown up by now. So Im leveling them up to the **Chicago Bears**.

**Cincinnati Reds:** Even though Cincy is called the Queen City for some weird reason (Im sorry, were you [named after a literal queen?](https://charlottenc.gov/AboutCharlotte/Pages/AboutTheQueenCity.aspx)), the main attraction is the zoo. I know everyone is gonna make the suggestion of the Cincinnati Harambes or Gorillas, but I feel like that could get problematic. Ive noticed that theres not many teams named after cats, and as an avid lover of cats, the best cat is the Bengal tiger which the Cincinnati zoo probably has, so Im renaming them to the **Cincinnati Bengals**.

**Pittsburgh Pirates:** Much like Detroit, Pittsburghs steel industry allowed the city to grow into what it is today. And to honor this, we should name them the **Pittsburgh Steelers**. Even better, they should be required to have the fastest players on their roster and should be required to steal second every chance they have.

**St. Louis Cardinals:** This is one of those teams whose name origin is pretty shit tbh. According to MLB.com, it literally came from the [color of their uniform](https://www.mlb.com/news/st-louis-cardinals-team-name-origin#:~:text=The%20story%20goes%20that%20St,struck%20a%20chord%20with%20fans.). Side note, there was another team in St. Louis named the Browns so obviously St. Louis has some fascination with colors. So if they like colors so much, they might as well rename their team to a color that has another meaning. In the early 1900s, St. Louis had a huge jazz scene, so Im gonna go with the **St. Louis Blues.**

**Milwaukee Brewers:** While Im sure Milwaukee has actual breweries that are good, the one theyre most known for should not be celebrated as the teams moniker. Instead, Im going with a state animal. While I like the Milwaukee Badgers as a name, this might get confused with the University of Wisconsin. Their second state animal ([yes, Wisconsin has two state animals; those over-achievers](https://www.eekwi.org/explore/state-facts/wisconsin-state-animals)), is the white-tailed deer, so a rebrand to the **Milwaukee Bucks** would be fitting.

## NL West:

**Arizona Diamondbacks:** This might be a hot take, but I really think the D-Backs need to drop the Arizona and just go with Phoenix. Primarily because the name Phoenix is cool. Anyways, just like Miami, the first thing I think about is how stupidly hot it gets out there. The sun just beats down on you with no remorse just like an aspiring baseball team should do. Im renaming them the **Phoenix Suns**.

**Colorado Rockies:** While the Rocky Mountains are an iconic part of Colorado, the rules dictate that each team gets a new name, so Im going with a mountain-adjacent name of the **Colorado Avalanche.**

**Los Angeles Dodgers:** If you couldnt tell, Im not a big fan of LA. There are so many nice cities and towns in California, but LA is just one of them. Also the name Dodgers is indigenous to Brooklyn as they were named after the trolley dodgers which is a much better name for San Francisco (please dont hate me for that). Im renaming them to the **Los Angeles Chargers** because everyone charges you so much money for everything in LA.

**San Diego Padres:** Yet another iconic name that is steeped in history, I tried to research other San Diego icons one of which being the obvious San Diego Bay, which houses an important naval base, among other things. To honor this maritime history, Im renaming them to the **San Diego Clippers**, because a clipper is a [cool ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper) with a cool name.

**San Francisco Giants:** Another well-known historical city, San Francisco boomed from a gold rush in 1849, and to go along with Philadelphia, the Giants are now changing their name to the **San Francisco 49ers**.","baseball",203,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/yomx0t/what_if_each_team_rebranded_to_better_reflect/"

It is a truly remarkable turnabout by the Mariners.   From the beginning of the season to the end of June, the Mariners basically lived within 3 games of .500.    The pitching staff regressed in terms of both health and performance.   The offense looked lifeless.   The opportunities that were presented were usually squandered and basically everyone on the lineup was underperforming.

After grand expectations for the M's to step up, this level of mediocrity was shocking.   It was like nothing had changed with this team, despite making the playoffs last season.    Seattle entered July having dug themselves into a massive hole.     

Seattle stood on the precipice of their event horizon.   Straddling over the edge of a potentially lost season.  If they wanted ANY chance to salvage their season, they had to play basically perfect.    

And as it turns out, that's just what they've done over the past month and change: Play basically perfect.  

In the 1995 Season, the Seattle Mariners adopted a mantra in their quest for their first playoff berth: *Refuse to Lose*   In the time since, the Seattle Mariners have called on the powers of ""Refusing to Lose"" to go on these torrid hot streaks.   When the fate of their season hangs in the balance, they become white hot.

In 2021, the Seattle Mariners went on 10-1 to end the month of September to keep their playoffs hopes alive into October

In 2022, the Seattle Mariners stood at 10 games under .500.   Their season looked dead in the water, they were being declared dead by Jomboy (it was Plouffe, not Jomboy).   But after that declaration, the M's went 22-3 from the end of June into the All-Star break.    Keeping their season alive.    Eventually culminating in them ending their two decade long playoff drought

In the 2023 Season, the Seattle Mariners were basically dead to rights, stuck behind a lot of great teams.   They've gone 24-10 so far, to bring themselves right back into it, a game and a half out of a Wild Card spot and just below 6 games out of the division.        

What's going to happen?   I can't really say.    That's the beauty of Chaos Ball, baby.","baseball",189,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15o4qxy/on_june_30th_the_seattle_mariners_were_3842_and/"

Did I do the American ritual right?

My first baseball experience was so cool! I requested suggestions in a Yankee Reddit, I thought I could share my experience ( also none of my friends have any idea about baseball ) 

I never been fan of the game cuz its too slow and boring imo ( that changed due to pitch clock ) but man baseball is really fun in stadium. For context I grew up in India and moved to the states like 6 years ago so basically didnt grow up in baseball culture ( although I have rewatched MoneyBall movie numerous times ) . 

Firstly Yankee Stadium was sooo cool, I felt the aura. I always wanted to go Wrigley Field first though cuz of a documentary I watched. 
Although I couldnt do the Monument Park ( damn you NYC traffic ) as suggested by few users I walked a whole lot around the stadium and it is pretty cool.

I spent around $150 for the whole game day experience but I tell you watching Judge homer made it all worth while. I so wanted him to score one. Felt lucky! 

Just I calmed down celebrating Judges Homer, Stanton hit a monster HR. I couldnt believe it. Baseball hits different I guess ! 

Enjoyed the rest of the game with some incredibly over priced food and ice cold beer as suggested by one user, get some hot dogs and beers as it is an American ritual in a baseball ball park. So technically I am Americanized now right? 

I have been to couple NFL, NBA games and home teams have always won. Was I the lucky charm for Yankees today? Perhaps. 

All in all great experience. Oh one last thing, watching bases stolen live is so underrated when compared to TV !","baseball",97,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12aa5q5/first_baseball_game_experience/"

I wanted to reach out to the greater baseball community to share what we have done, what we hope to do, and how you can contribute/support our efforts, if interested.

First off, **why should you care about what is happening in Oakland?** They are the worst team in baseball, playing in front of the smallest crowds, at arguably MLB's worst stadium. This is the prevailing narrative; it has been carefully concocted and orchestrated by John Fisher (Owner) and his spineless puppet, Dave Kaval (President) to drive fans away in droves so they can claim that lack of support is the reason for relocation.

After the pandemic season, the cost of our season ticket packages doubled, popular benefits cut (ie discounted merchandise, 50% off concessions (INCLUDING BEER), and free parking), and we watched all stars such as Matt Olson, Matt Chapman, Sean Murphy, Chris Bassitt, Marcus Semien and many other fan favorites get traded away, a cycle us lifelong A's fans are all too familiar with. Despite the plot of Major League playing out in real time, our fans have organized and materialized to show that we not only exist, but we will fight for our team.

If you think something like this could not happen to your team/fanbase, you are mistaken. [Milwaukee is poised to be next in line for public extortion for a stadium handout.](https://www.si.com/fannation/mlb/fastball/news/milwaukee-brewers-threaten-to-relocate-over-ballpark-and-money-issues) The Brewer's owner, Mark Attanasio, is also conveniently head of the relocation committee for the Oakland to Vegas move. Manfred is a henchmen for the owners, not a steward for the game; we deserve better as fans!

* Host a final Reverse Boycott game with fans in Oakland on 9/23. [See our open letter to the A's](https://www.oakland68s.org/open-letter-to-the-a-s) asking the organization to donate funds to Oakland nonprofits if we help drive attendance. We have not heard back from the A's, and if we do not, we intend to throw a tailgate in the parking lot, but not attend the game.
* Help force a greater discussion around team relocation within baseball and professional sports. We ask for support as we hope our efforts will lead to greater consideration of the fans of all teams, rather than just ours.

**How you can get involved:**

Stand with us as fans when we visit your ballparks. We ask all fans stand in silence to begin the 5th inning to pay tribute to the Athletic's 55 years in Oakland. After the first batter, we ask you all to join us in our ""SELL THE TEAM"" chants.

(We are a certified 501(c)(3) &amp; we can provide receipts for any/all monetary or in kind donations upon request. All donations go towards fan giveaways, travel, and shipping costs to/from different ballparks. Any surplus funds go towards the purchase of group tickets for our fan-focused home games to subsidize the cost of tickets for our community members who have more passion than financial means)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Donate your time**
   * If you live in the area of one of the ballparks we will be visiting, and want to help pass out cheer cards ahead of the game, please comment or DM. We need help as outsiders navigating the various ballpark quirks, and it is always helpful to have local connections.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Donate your VOICE**
   * Help spread the word about how Rob Manfred is trying to gaslight a whole fanbase. Help us rally for support within your own respective fanbases. Together as a community of fans, our voices are FAR stronger than any fanbase alone. If the A's ultimately do relocate, we hope to collectively leave enough of a black eye on Manfred and MLB that they will think twice about trying to do this to YOUR team in the future!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Donate your resources**
   * Out of respect for the rules of this community, the intent of this post is not to ask for monetary donations. You can find more info at [Oakland68s.org](https://oakland68s.org/).

"2022-10-18",1666106100,"6 Straight Trips to the LCS: How the Astros have accomplished such an incredible feat","The Astros are the most hated team in all of professional sports right now. The cheating scandal still casts a shadow over this masterclass of an organization that has essentially invented modern baseball analytics. Still though, the Astros reaching 6 consecutive league championship series is an incredible feat. It's a level of dominance we haven't seen since the Braves of the 1990s who made 8 consecutive NLCS trips. So how have the Astros done it?

I recognize that for the first few seasons of this run, the Astros were undeniably gaining an unfair advantage with their sign stealing. However, you may be surprised by their numbers in the following years remaining roughly the same even as they lost several key contributors, fired their manager and were in a PR hellscape of their own design. 

Below is a list of cumulative data from, in my opinion, the three most important statistics to gauge team success. OPS+ analyzes the efficiency of the offense against the league average, FIP isolates the quality of the pitching from the fielding and ERA+ analyzes the efficiency of pitching against the league average:

&amp;#x200B;

||OPS+|FIP|ERA+|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2017|123 (1st in MLB)|3.91 (6th in MLB)|99 (16th in MLB)|
|2018|106 (5th in MLB)|3.23 (1st in MLB)|134 (1st in MLB)|
|2019|119 (1st in MLB)|3.98 (3rd in MLB)|127 (1st in MLB)|
|2021|113 (1st in MLB)|4.12 (12th in MLB)|114 (7th in MLB)|
|2022|111 (6th in MLB)|3.28 (1st in MLB)|134 (2nd in MLB)|

The Astros in every season have either been the best batting team or best pitching team in major league baseball in every single season since 2017. They really hit their peak in 2019. Verlander was the Cy Young and put together one of the best seasons of his illustrious career. Alvarez and Brantley were impactful newcomers that joined an already deadly lineup. The Astros won 107 games and made all other MLB teams look silly. A white hot Nationals team got the better of them in one of the biggest World Series upsets in baseball history.

Below is a table displaying the difference between the strikeout rate of their hitters vs the strikeout rate of their pitchers:

&amp;#x200B;

||Hitters K%|Pitchers K%|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2017|17.3 (1st in MLB)|26.1 (2nd in MLB)|\+8.8|
|2018|19.5 (2nd in MLB)|28.5 (1st in MLB)|\+9|
|2019|18.2 (1st in MLB)|27.9 (1st in MLB)|\+9.7|
|2021|19.4 (1st in MLB)|24.0 (12th in MLB)|\+4.6|
|2022|19.5 (2nd in MLB)|26.0 (2nd in MLB)|\+6.5|

The Astros every season seem to win the strikeout battle. Strikeouts are such a key stat in major league baseball because of the way baseball works and the way runs are scored. The Astros are consistently striking out less than every other team. If you're not striking out, you're either walking or putting the ball in play. Eventually, putting more balls in play or drawing more walks than your opponents is going to lead to more runs. 

In the playoffs, the Astros are able to take advantage of these differences in strikeouts. The Astros get more baserunners and put the ball in play more than their opponents. Even fly ball outs and groundouts can advance baserunners unlike a strikeout. The Astros are much better at this strikeout ratio than just about every other team. 

There are obviously many factors that make a team successful. In the playoffs, any team can get hot and run the table for a World Series. Baseball is a long run game condensed into short run spurts during October. However, the Houston Astros, hated as they might be, have found the formula to maximize their odds of winning each and every year. In the last 6 seasons they have advanced to the ALCS every time, made 3 World Series appearances and have captured 1 ""title"". However, what this organization has accomplished is pretty amazing, they may have the perfect formula for winning baseball.","baseball",620,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/y79ta5/6_straight_trips_to_the_lcs_how_the_astros_have/"

"2022-11-12",1668288052,"Forgotten baseball history: when Tony La Russa had Mark McGwire start the game as a pinch hitter","The year is 2000. NSYNC, Britney Spears, and Creed are at the top of the charts. People are flocking to theaters to see Tom Hanks talk to a volleyball and Russell Crowe ask people if they are entertained. It's only been two years since Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris's single-season home run record, and it will be several more years before everyone finally admits they knew he was on steroids all along. McGwire's manager, Tony La Russa, is still viewed as a brilliant innovator and probably not the kind of guy who would try to play the ""do you know who I am?"" card when being arrested for DUI.

In the second half of the 2000 season, La Russa found himself in a bit of a pickle regarding McGwire, who went on the DL with patella tendonitis just before the All Star break, at which point he had been tied with Griffey for the major league home run lead. McGwire could still swing a bat, but he couldn't run or play defense.

By September, after undergoing numerous treatments to avoid surgery ([including accupuncture, according to this ESPN article that reads like an OOTP news update](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/2000/0707/623534.html)) the Cardinals decided to let McGwire return to the active roster despite his obvious shortcomings. There were no more interleague games on the schedule, so DH was not an option. McGwire would strictly be used as a pinch hitter, in essentially a homer-or-nothing role. Legging out a double would be basically impossible for him. In the event that he did manage to reach first base, he would have to be lifted for a pinch runner.

This meant that bringing in McGwire meant potentially having to use two players from the bench, but it was September in the era when teams could use the whole 40-man roster after September 1, so that wasn't such a big deal. La Russa would have a potentially very powerful weapon to use in key late-game moments down the stretch as the Cardinals tried to wrap up the NL Central title.

However, the Cardinals happened to be on a road trip when McGwire came off the DL. This afforded La Russa a unique opportunity, which brings us to the unusual title of my post. Since the Cardinals would be batting in the top half of the 1st inning before taking the field, he could pencil in McGwire to any of the first 3 spots in the lineup, at the position of whichever player usually held that spot. He would get his plate appearance in the top of the 1st, and then be replaced in the field by the normal starter in the bottom half. Essentially, he would be starting as a pinch hitter, hopefully being able to give the Cardinals a 1st inning lead. La Russa would use this unusual lineup technique for six games against the Brewers and Pirates:

[September 8, 2000, at Milwaukee](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL200009080.shtml): McGwire is in the starting lineup as the second baseman, batting second. He would be penciled in at 2B and batting second for the first four games of this six-game experiment, I assume because the incumbent starter at the position, Fernando Vina, was on the DL, and whichever utility guy was filling in (either Placido Polanco or Craig Paquette) was usually batting 2nd in the order. McGwire struck out against Brewers starter Jeff C. D'Amico, who is notable as one of two guys named Jeff D'Amico to pitch in the majors in 2000. In the bottom of the first, Paquette went out to man second base and played the rest of the game there. The Cardinals lost, 6-5. An inauspicious start to the experiment.

[September 9, 2000, at Milwaukee](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL200009090.shtml): McGwire batting second, as ""second baseman."" He popped out to the shortstop, and Polanco took over 2B duties. The Cardinals won, 7-6.

[September 10, 2000, at Milwaukee](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIL/MIL200009100.shtml): Hit by pitch! We have crippled Mark McGwire as a baserunner for the first time. Naturally, La Russa pinch-runs for him with Placido Polanco, who was going to be the ""starter"" at 2B anyway, thus neatly avoiding the whole ""using 2 players from the bench in order to use one guy as a pinch hitter"" conundrum (which... I guess was the point of this whole exercise?). Cardinals lose, 4-3.

[September 11, 2000, at Pittsburgh](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT200009110.shtml): Finally, the result everyone wanted! A 2-run dinger off Pirates legend Jose Silva, with Cardinals leadoff man JD Drew having helpfully gotten on in front of him with a double. Polanco came out to play 2B, and the Cardinals won, 8-4.

[September 12, 2000, at Pittsburgh](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT200009120.shtml): Here's where La Russa started shaking things up, because why not? He had McGwire as the left fielder and leadoff hitter. It would be the only game of his career that he started in the leadoff spot. He grounded out, and then Paquette came out to play LF. Despite McGwire being a non-factor, the Cardinals won, 11-1.

[September 13, 2000, at Pittsburgh](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT200009130.shtml): The last game of the experiment, and this time McGwire was batting second as the SS. He singled, and was lifted for pinch runner Polanco, who later scored on a Will Clark double. Polanco took over at short, with usual starting SS Edgar Renteria getting a day off. Cardinals won, 9-5.

After that, the road trip was over, and McGwire was exclusively on pinch hitting duty (actual, normal pinch hitting). Even when the Cards went on another road trip in late September, the starting-as-a-pinch-hitter experiment was not repeated.

So, did it work? The Cardinals went 4-2 during the experiment, and 8-5 during the subsequent games in which he pinch hit. McGwire himself slashed .333/.474/.733 with 2 homers, including both the starting games and the pinch hitting games. But there's not a lot you can say about a 19PA sample. The Cardinals had a 10 game lead over the 2nd place Reds when McGwire came off the DL, and that's exactly the margin by which they won the division. So I'm not sure you can say it made too much of a difference.

In the playoffs, La Russa continued using McGwire as a pinch hitter, utilizing starting pitchers to pinch run for him if he reached base. The sports hot-take universe, such as it was in 2000, had much to say about it: https://nypost.com/2000/10/14/la-russa-sticks-by-use-of-mcgwire/

That 2000 Cardinals postseason, of course, is probably most famous for being the time that Rick Ankiel came down with a terminal case of Steve Blass Disease on live TV, thus paving the way for his second career as a platoon outfielder.

Anyway, this is a little tidbit of baseball history that I remember from my teen years that I don't think a lot of people know about, so I wrote up this little summary that wound up being about 50x longer than I thought it would be.

#Introduction for new and renewed interest fans.

Baseball has a long season. I don't just mean that in terms of time between opening day and the World Series (which can be considered long as it is), but also the 162 games played in 183 days, 13 times against the same 4 teams each. It can be daunting, and many people lose interest by ""the dog days"" of June and July. 

This guide is meant to help you if you wish to avoid being one of those who feels overwhelmed and loses interest a couple weeks after Opening Day.

First and foremost if you are a new fan or newly returning, you must remember one thing: you do not need to watch every game. Many football fans, and even some basketball and hockey fans, find this difficult, they're used to setting aside a few nights a week to watch their team, and they can watch all the games. Baseball isn't like that. For the next six months, your team will only have 23 days where they won't be playing a game. And some of the games they play will start as early as 9:20am (Pacific Time), others will end after 1am (Eastern Time). If you miss a game it's okay, odds are there's another one tomorrow. If you miss a week, no big deal, hell if you get busy for a few months and aren't able to watch you team, that's not an issue, because you can still *follow* your team.

Baseball is a game to be followed. In the old days it meant picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores. Now it means being able to have a final score texted/tweeted/messaged/emailed/what-evered to you the minute the game ends, or rolling over in bed when you can't sleep and grabbing your phone to check the West Coast scores. It means being able to check reddit in the morning to see any breaking news from across the league, or catch a story you missed. We live in a time where you can go to MLB.com and get a recap of every game from last night in less than 10 minutes. Honestly, baseball was made to be consumed, and the technology age makes it easier than ever, whether you want to spend hours every day pouring over stats and analysis, or 15 seconds to see how your team and their playoff rivals did today.

The rest of this guide is mostly dedicated to ways that you can help yourself follow your team, and if you have time follow the entirety of MLB.

#World Baseball Classic

If you are new to the sport, you may not have even known that there is a worldwide competition (ostensibly) every four years that pit country against country to crown a World Champion. Part of that is the fact that we haven't had one since 2017 as the covid pandemic disrupted the qualification process for the 2021 edition scheduled to take place in 2020, and global travel restrictions prevented rescheduling until this year. But IT CAME BACK! And we won't have to wait four yours for the next edition as they plan on the next classic to be held in 2026, on opposite even years from the Olympics in case baseball is re-added as a sport so there won't be any overlap in qualification and competition cycles between the two events.

This years format involved 20 teams split into 4 groups. Each group played a round robin group stage, with the top two teams from each group advancing to an eight team single elimination tournament. Mexico, USA, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Japan, Italy, Cuba, and Australia advanced to the knock out stage which culminated in an absolutely dream matchup of USA-Japan in the final with the final at bat of the game coming down to Shohei Ohtani pitching to Mike Trout - if they had scripted it in a movie no one would have believed it.

If you missed this year's edition definitely set time aside in March 2026 to watch the next one - the atmospheres at most of the games are absolutely amazing as Latin American and Asian teams have fans that go all out and it truly feels like playoff baseball in the spring.

For more information on results you can [check out the World Baseball Classic website](https://www.mlb.com/world-baseball-classic/schedule/2023-03-07) or, just as helpful, [the 2023 tournament wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Baseball_Classic)

#Rule Changes for MLB 2023

The following changes will not be in place for the World Baseball Classic but will for MLB.

Updates from 2022 One Year Changes

 - REMOVED: Rosters will be expanded from 26 to 28 players in April with no limit on pitchers due to shortened spring training.
 - MADE PERMANANT: In extra innings the person in the batting order immediately before the lead off hitter will start on second base. This rule does not apply in the postseason.

Permanent Changes for 2023:

 - Pitch clock of 15 seconds with bases empty, 20 seconds with runners on, beginning when the pitcher receives the ball. Pitchers failing to begin their motion when the pitch clock expires will be penalized with an automatic ball.
 - Batters must be in the box ready with at least 8 seconds remaining. Penalty: Automatic Strike
 - Batters allowed one time out per plate appearance.
 - Pitchers may call pitches using pitch com.
 - Pitchers are allowed two free pick offs attempts or step offs per plate appearance. On subsequent pick off attempts either an out must be made, or the runners advance one base for free. If runners advance, the free pick off/step offs reset.
 - Ban on certain shifts: teams must have two players on the left and right sides of second base on the infield, all four must have feet on infield dirt.
 - Bases have been enlarged from 15 inches on each side to 18 inches on each side.
 - Position players are only allowed to pitch when:
  - Their team is down by 8+ runs
  - Their team is up by 10 runs in the 9th
  - Anytime in extra innings

Potential future changes being testes in the minors:

 - Automatic ball/strike calling.
  - Fully automated strike zone 
  - Umps calling strikes, but teams having 3 challenges to a ball/strike call.

Rule Emphasis

 - Balks for pitchers who do not come fully set before delivering a pitch will be called more often.

#Finding a Team

I always recommend following the local team since you'll have more access to news about them in the local media and should be able to get their radio broadcast, as well as TV broadcasts of them if you have cable/satellite/streaming, and depending on where you're at the occasional over the air game, but if you don't live by a team or don't want to follow the local team, or are just looking for a second team to follow, [I wrote this in depth guide to picking a team that's the right fit for you.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/11coiba/looking_for_a_team_to_follow_in_2023_help_is/)

---

#Knowing Where Different Teams Stand

Every year ESPN, Sports Illustrated, FOX, NBC, and every other sports related site puts out their season previews. These are great for getting a basic rundown of what is going on with each team, and a simple google search will bring up a plethora of possible articles to read.

For a succinct snapshot of team expectations, [you can look at the fangraphs projected standings](https://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Standings) and [projected playoff odds](https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds) or for a slightly different model you can check the [PECOTA projected standings and playoff odds.](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/) While these aren't as in depth as team previews, looking at both can show which teams are consensus favorites, and which ones are more wild cards in how they're expected to perform.

If what you really want is a fans perspective on what each team's expectations condensed into a few short comments, I'd highly recommend going through each teams day from our annual ""Why will X team exceed expectations?"" series which is currently running every weekday and stickied.

#R/Baseball

Alright, so plugging r/baseball on r/baseball seems a bit redundant, but I think it's a good reminder that this is a great hub for all your MLB news throughout the season while still letting you see the occasional amazing college/minor league/foreign league performance.

During the season there are a number of features to keep you informed of all the goings on around baseball. 

Every day of the season (and a portion of the offseason) there are General Discussion threads called Around the Horn. These are great places to ask questions and discuss anything that you want to know about baseball but don't feel like it deserves it's own post. In the Around the Horn post you'll be able to see a full schedule of what is going on around R/Baseball every week.

During the week the subreddit runs a number of features. **Please note that the mods are still unsure of exactly what features they will be running this year.*:

**Daily: Nightly Pick'Em** - A nine year running contest to pick the result of one game every day. [Here's last year's introduction thread where you can find details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/mh9ffe/nightly_pick_em_rbaseball_edition_season_seven_a/)

**Monday: Power Rankings** - A team of 30 fans from every team in baseball, led by ~~masochist~~ fearless leader /u/kasutori_jack, releases their composite power rankings of the 30 teams. This leads to well thought out discussions and some in depth analysis, as well as salty fans crying about how their team is underrated (there may be more of the latter than the former, but it's still a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of how every team is doing). 

**Monday: State of the Subreddits** -  /u/double_dose_larry took over posting a State of the Subreddits post that gives the top post from each team's subreddit from the last week. This is a great roundup post for staying up to date on what all the different team fandoms are feeling, and helps you catch any milestones you might have otherwise missed.

**Tuesday: Weekly Awards** - Led by /u/lemcoe9 a different team of a fan from every team releases the results of their weekly (and monthly) voting for who the best position player and pitcher was since the last vote was taken. Once again, a great way to keep track of which players are on hot streaks, and who's dominating the league.

**Wednesday: Wild Card Wednesday** - Each week a new contest, trivia game, or just out of the box fun thread will be stickied! Got an idea? Let the mods know!

**Thursdays: Division Discussions** - Rotating between the Easts, Centrals, and Wests to do some more in depth talk about where the playoff races and teams stand. If you only have time for one r/baseball thread every week and want to keep up with the league, this is the thread to set aside time for. 
 
**Friday: Trash Talk/Compliment/Complaint** - FRIDAYS ARE FUN DAYS, ROTATING BETWEEN TRASH TALK, COMPLIMENT, TRASH TALK, AND COMPLAINT THREADS! TRADITION STATES ALL COMMENTS BE IN ALL CAPS AND ENDING IN EXCLAMATION POINTS! ROTATION IS USED RATHER THAN HAVE A SET DAY FOR EACH ALL SEASON BECAUSE IT'S A LONG SEASON AND ANY ONE OF THE THREE THREADS CAN GET STALE FAST IF YOU DON'T LEAVE TIME FOR MORE AMMUNITION! 

**Saturday**: Saturday is when the mods usually plug in occasional things that don't necessarily deserve weekly attention. Things like in depth stat discussions, memorabilia sharing, craft projects, etc.

**Sunday: Game of the Week** - Sunday is the one day a week where we get together as a subreddit to watch a baseball game together, since it's the one time every week where there's only one game going on and there's guaranteed to be a game. The Sunday Night Baseball game thread is usually posted a couple hours before the first pitch.

In addition the playoffs, and select premier match-ups (mostly at the very end of the season where there is a lot riding on a regular season game, as well as opening day) there are game threads for all r/baseball users. These are neutral thread, for more info on less neutral ones skip to the next section. This has gone back and forth the last few years with people asking for more game threads, then many of said game threads being empty because everyone is in their own team's sub discussing the game. If you have ideas for what sort of games deserve r/baseball game threads, leave them in the comments.

In addition to all these features, it really is a great place to keep up with breaking news and highlights. It'll be posted here minutes after someone tweets it, and long before it's on MLB.com. Team beat writers get the stories first, and it's easier to check in here a couple times a day than follow every one of them.

**Another note - for the best R/Baseball experience, you should use Old Reddit, which you can access by visiting old.reddit.com/r/baseball.** Old reddit includes a fun sidebar with a full scoreboard of the day's action as well as the current league standings (with little flags that tell you who's in wild card position).

---

#Your Team's Subreddit (And other team subs as well)

The mods at r/baseball have one goal - help you have the best possible reddit baseball experience, and a LOT of that is helping you get connected to other fans of your team (which feels a little like a cop-out because it means less work for us if you're doing more on your team's sub, but your team's mods aren't complaining.)

One of the main draws of team subs (other than in depth discussion with like-fan-minded users, getting breaking news and analysis on your team, team-memes, and other reddit discussions that come up from a group of individuals who can agree on one thing) are game threads. At this time (to the best of my knowledge) every team sub hosts game threads for their team's games, and you can easily access them in the sidebar during the season by clicking on the team's logo in the schedule. We like to keep the game threads in team subs for a few reasons, one of which is we want to support the team subs and send them relevant traffic when we can because they really do an amazing job, another is because with 15 games a day this place would look like crap if we had game threads for every game or let users post them as they please (we've tried it, it blots out news, discussion, and highlights and looks like crap, baseball doesn't have only a couple days set aside for games or focus on marquee match ups like many other sports, it's 2430 games played in 183 days and is better when it's spread out.)

Even if you're not a game thread person though, getting connected with a good team sub can make disappointing seasons more bearable, and great seasons more exciting, and I know plenty of users that said that their team's sub basically keeps them fans. Team subs are also a great place to get connected to...

#Twitter, Podcasts, and YouTube Channels

The best way to find the people to follow/sites to visit that interest you the most are to hang around your team's sub and note which Tweets/Sites that are linked to that most often peak your interest. Your list of favorite baseball writers is going to be different than my favorite list, and finding the right twitter personalities, podcasts hosts, and YouTubers can make game analysis more interesting for you even if your team is playing like crap and it's the middle of July.

Here are some common suggestions for some baseball twitter accounts, podcasts, and YouTube Channels that are often recommended by those around the subreddit to get you started, but like I said, find what you like and follow those:

#The Statistical Titans: Baseball Reference and Fangraphs

Literally every day you will find a link or to BaseballReference.com or Fangraphs.com here, it's a given, and it's because these are the two most extensive free baseball databases that are easy to navigate. If you want to look up anything about baseball history, check Baseball Reference, if you want to look up how players stack up with non-proprietary advanced metrics or read an insightful blog post about why someone is overrated/underrated or overperforming/underperforming, check Fangraphs. With these two sites you have all the stats and figures you need to make a competent argument for basically anything you want with a little cherry picking.

A large part of the modern baseball world is statistics and you're going to find yourself getting more immersed in discussing the game if you can get a handle on all the terms getting thrown around. **If you are brand new to baseball, take a little while to get to know the game before diving into these sites**, but if you have a handle on the basics and are ready to know what this WAR everyone is talking about is, dive into the glossaries and find the statistics.

When you get the basics, creating your own analysis doesn't seem as daunting, and one of the reasons I love baseball is that I can deconstruct pretty much every play and find some meaning behind it. If you are like that and enjoy numbers, theoretical projections, and breaking things down into simple figures before reconstructing them into something long and beautiful, then learning the basics of sabrmetrics will make you a baseball fan for life. If, on the other hand, you just want to enjoy the game for the beautiful pastime that it is by watching, then we've got a little bit to go through...

#Advanced Stat Tracking... aka the Stat Junkies' Crack

Fangraphs and Baseball Reference contain almost all the stats you'd need for a lifetime, but sometimes you just need something different, and there are some very helpful places on the internet to find some other, more specific or advanced data.

If you are looking for Pitch f/x data, strikezone plots, and/or a breakdown of a pitcher's pitches, check out [BrookesBaseball.net](http://www.brooksbaseball.net/). You can quickly find specific at bats in games, or entire games scatter plots to ~~ruthlessly ridicule and rant about an umpire~~ see why that last pitch was called a strike.

If you want to look up certain statcast data, like which pitchers are throwing the hardest, which fielders are having the fastest sprint speeds, who's hitting the ball the furthest, etc., you should check out [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/). Look at the ""Statistics"" and ""Leaderboards"" sections for more information.

If you are into looking up really specific historical queries, or just want pretty much every baseball stat ever, you can usually find it in the [Lahman Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).

If you are looking for MLB API for your next coding project, you can [find that information here.](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/) And if you're *really* into statistical analysis and want to test out your R skills, [baseballr is the package of choice.](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)

#Where to Watch? - Your TV and Streaming Guide

So a big part of baseball is, you know, actually being able to watch the games (though as I talk about at the end, it might not necessarily be the case for you, and that doesn't mean you can't enjoy baseball, skip down and see what I'm talking about in the final section).

**TV Networks**

Fox/FS1- ""Baseball Night in America"": exclusive regional coverage of 2 or 3 Saturday night games on the broadcast network starting Memorial Day weekend. Non-exclusive games on the cable network, usually Saturday afternoon with some irregularly scheduled weeknight games as well. Also includes the All-Star Game, both division series and the league championship series for one league (AL in 2023) which are split between OTA and cable channels, and the entire World Series on the broadcast network.

ESPN - Exclusive Sunday Night Baseball game. Usually on ESPN proper, but may get bumped to ESPN2 in the early part of the season because of the NBA and NHL playoffs. None are currently planned, but can also go to ABC as well. Also includes opening night, the Little League Weekend game (which is on a Sunday anyway), the Home Run Derby, a few extra late-season games, and the entire Wild Card round of the playoffs (with some overflow to ABC and ESPN2).

TBS - Non-exclusive Tuesday night game all season. Also includes the other league's division series and league championship series (NL for 2023). Overflow is handled on TNT for the division series.

MLB Network - Simulcasts local home team broadcasts daily; many days they'll have multiple games. About once a week (though irregular as to which day) they have he non-exclusive MLB Network Showcase, which is produced in-house. Simulcasts and the Showcase are subject to blackout in home markets, and another simulcast will be substituted instead.

**Streaming**

Apple TV+ - Two exclusive Friday Night Baseball games produced in conjunction with MLB Network. 

Peacock/NBC - MLB Sunday Leadoff, an exclusive early Sunday game (first few games start at 11:30 am ET, the rest at noon) will air 19 of 20 weeks on Peacock. The May 7th game will be simulcast on NBC.

YouTube - Game of the Week Live on YouTube, an exclusive free stream on the MLB YouTube page. It's usually a Wednesday afternoon game, but day and time may vary. No purchase necessary!

MLB.tv - Subscriber package for watching out-of-town local broadcasts. One game a day is always given as a free sample. Blacked out in the teams' home markets (due to deals between teams and sports networks - it has nothing to do with trying to get you to the ballpark) and for some national broadcasts. See section below for more details.

ESPN+ - One local broadcast a day (not the same game as the freebie on MLB.tv) is simulcast live on ESPN+ in addition to being on MLB.tv. Also on Sundays it simulcasts the Sunday Night Baseball game. More of a throw-in than anything, but if you already have an ESPN+ subscription it's already paid for.

There are also streaming services that grant access to most of the previously mentioned channels: 

 - Sling TV Orange package gets you ESPN, ESPN 2, and TBS. 
 - Sling TV Blue package gets you FOX, FS1, TBS.
 - Youtube TV gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, TBS, and some regional sports networks.
 - HULU Live gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, FS2, TBS, and some regional sports networks.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Live a Little gets you FOX, ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1, and TBS and your regional sports networks.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Just Right adds MLB Network to the Live a Little channels.
 - AT&amp;T TV Now Go Big adds FS2 to the Just Right channels.
 - FUBO Premier gets you FOX, FS1, FS2, ESPN, ESPN 2, and some of your regional sports networks
 - FUBO Extra adds MLB Network

**NOTE - With Bally filing bankruptcy there is an air of unease on what the future of regional sports networks versus direct from MLB streaming is going to look like. Stay tuned around here as news of this kind will be posted and discussed quickly.**

#MLB.TV - the Ultimate Fan Investment

Alright, so a few things to cover with this, first of all YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEGALLY STREAM IN MARKET GAMES IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA. MLB.tv uses your IP address to see where you are located, and if it pings back that you are in a team's home market it will not let you watch the game LIVE. [Here is where you can find what games MLB.tv will black you out from.](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlbtv/help-center/blackout-info.jsp?question=which-teams-am-i-blacked-out-from) National broadcasts on ESPN, FOX, and TBS are also subject to blackouts within the United States (MLB Network games are not). Before you ask, yes there are less than legal ways to get around this (spoofing your IP address, subreddit dedicated to mlb streams, etc.), but I won't be talking about those in detail here. 

**International fans**, the only potential games you will be blacked out of are the Apple TV games and postseason games if your country has a network that paid for postseason broadcasting rights.

Even if you are blacked out, you will be able to watch the game 90 minutes after it finishes, so if you work a late shift or stay up late it might be worth it for you anyways even if you only want to follow one team.

Pricing tip - [if you donate $25 to become a MLB Players Alumni Association Fan Member you get 50% off MLB.tv.](https://www.mlb.com/mlbpaa/membership/fans)

Military members and college students, don't forget to apply your 35% discount! **T-Mobile Customers**, you can get MLB.tv FOR FREE using the T-Mobile Tuesdays App - it has been confirmed that this is back this year but I have not heard an official date yet. 

""But I don't want to watch EVERY out of market game, I just want to watch MY team!"" Cool, for $20 less there's a single team option that will allow you to watch all your team's non-blacked out games! Personally, I'd pay the extra $20 for the opportunity to watch every deGrom, Cole, and Scherzer start, or put the Cubs on in the background while working on a Friday afternoon, but to each their own.

""But I don't want to commit for a full year!"" That's okay, there's a monthly option as well in case you know there are months where you can't watch as much. 

Some of the fun features of MLB.tv include the ability to watch four games at once and quickly swap your audio from one to another (seriously, I'm never on commercial break when I'm watching baseball, unless there's only one game on I'm able to watch it all, and in September that's huge) and condensed games. What are condensed games? They go through and cut out all the time between pitches and innings, meaning if you want to watch a whole game in less than a half hour (or are searching desperately for a play to make a .gif or streamable out of that for some reason isn't considered a highlight) it's really easy. If you're someone who really wants to get into the game but can't figure out how to grind through watching a full game, Condensed Games are great for keeping up with a team while you learn the little details between pitches that somehow make watching the catcher twiddle his fingers exciting for some fans.

**Newly included this year**, the previously separate MiLB.tv has been rolled in to the MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to watch minor league games from across the country! No more debating whether to pay $20 more to watch that one prospect for a week then forget you have the subscription because there are always MLB games on at the same time - access to watching any minor league games is now included! All triple A and double A teams will have their games streamed, and select lower level clubs will as well.

Also, MLB has added some great baseball documentaries to your MLB.tv subscription, giving you access to more than just games. They also have ""Baseball Zen"" videos that are great for relaxing to.

**In addition, there is a great resource to enhance your total immersion into baseball if there are multiple games going on.** Please note you must already be logged into MLB.tv to make them work. Baseball Reference has [Stream Finder](https://www.baseball-reference.com/stream-finder.shtml) which lets you customize your preferences so MLB.tv will always switch to the game that is most relevant to you. This is great if you play fantasy and want to keep up with your players, are waiting for someone to hit a milestone, or if you want to make sure your action is broken into to follow a no-hitter in progress.

MLB.tv also gives you a free subscription to...

#MLB At Bat - The Most Underrated Way to Stay Connected to Baseball

An [MLB At Bat](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/help-center/mlb-audio-is-now-at-bat) subscription gives you access to every team's radio stream for every game during the season and postseason *completely blackout free* across devices. If there's a day game, you can bet I'm listening to it at work, if I'm mowing the lawn on a Saturday I'm listening to a game, when I can't sleep at night, on comes a West Coast game.

Baseball was made to be on the radio, it's a sport that is very easy to follow the action with the right announcer. At work (or school) it's great because you can half listen, and when the announcer gets excited you can instantly tune back in to hear what's going on. This is the most underrated way to stay connected to your team throughout the year. Before I could afford MLB.tv, this was the way to go, and it honestly makes me question every year whether getting the MLB.tv package is worth is when I can get 80% of the entertainment value from listening to the games (and every year I manage to ""forget"" to unsubscribe, for many reasons listed above).

Also, as a nice bonus this year, that MiLB.tv subscription that got rolled into MLB.tv was included in MLB At Bat as well! So if you decide you want to watch some games but don't want to commit to an entire year of MLB.tv, you can catch some upcoming prospects playing in the minors without spending the big bucks.

#How to watch baseball?

So this is a question that we get from many new fans who are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on and why people find this game so fascinating. I'll get the elephant in the room out of the way, yes there are some ""boring"" parts of watching baseball on TV. The camera fans to a batter spitting and adjusting his gloves, the pitcher adjusts his crotch then licks his fingers, random shots of a bored looking manager, etc. When you are actually at the ballpark you can be watching where the catcher and fielders set up to try to predict the pitch that is coming (read *The Hidden Language of Baseball* by Paul Dickson for some great insight into how to interpret this), but on TV it's not usually the case. This is where I have some suggestions for new fans trying to get into it.

First off, if you are looking for just a relaxing day, embrace the slow pace with a beer and veg out on the couch while watching. It's meant to be slow and relaxing (until it gets tense and exciting, usually with runners on). Seriously, when was the last time you just sat and did nothing? Mid July afternoon games are a perfect way to reach that zen of half-consciousness, until something happens to get you sucked into the action.

Another option to stay engaged is keeping score. I find keeping score relaxing and looking back through a scorebook can be fun to see what you were doing a few years ago (except for that damn unfinished scorecard from 2015 where A-Rod hit the most predictable home run in Twins-Yankees history and I sent my scorecard flying to the other side of the room). As NPR once put it, keeping score is a knowledge making activity, and if you have the time and patience for it it is a great way to learn the game. There are [a couple](https://teachbaseball.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/how-to-keep-an-official-scorebook/) different [guides](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/scoring.shtml) to [keeping score](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/baseball_basics/keeping_score.jsp), and most scorebooks/cards will have a brief example of how to do so. If you have any questions, the Around the Horn thread is a great place to ask!

Gamethreads are another way to get together with other baseball fans and pass the time between pitches, especially in team subs you get to know the regulars and conversations start to wonder away from baseball at times throughout the game, and that's fine. Baseball is an excuse to enjoy a summer day.

For those that want to actually understand what is going on during that time, though, there are some options. *Watching Baseball Smarter* by Zack Hample (who despite his reputation on this subreddit knows some stuff and actually pops in from time to time to comment on different things) is a good starting place for new fans. *Baseball for Dummies* and *The Complete Idiots Guide to Baseball* are also good starting points for those willing to sit and read for a little bit.

If it helps, I wrote two posts on /r/minnesotatwins to help newcomers understand some of the nuances of the game:

 - [Watching the Count](https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/ilxdn9/cardith_explains_watching_the_count/)
 - [Bullpen Management](https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/i957mm/offday_post_cardith_explains_bullpen_management/)

#Where to watch highlights and game recaps.

There are many many places to see highlights and game recaps, this is not an exhaustive list, but is a good start.

For highlights, bigger highlights will often be posed here on r/baseball a few minutes after they occur, [if you wish to post them please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/wiki/rules) They also appear relatively quickly on MLB.com in each games Gameday area. For a pretty slick collection of highlights from across MLB, https://baseball.theater/ is a great place to exclusively watch highlights.

There are a few ways to get great game recaps. If you have MLB Network, every day *Quick Pitch* is an hour-long show that recaps every game from the previous day. It usually starts after MLB Tonight (about 10pm EDT) or whatever game MLB Network is showing finishes up, and runs until 10am EDT the next day. MLB.com also puts out recaps of every game by the next morning, usually a 2-5 minutes quick rundown of highlights that can be found on the game recap. It also puts out *Fastcast* videos on youtube and their website every morning which has a brief rundown of all the games from the previous day. [Here's an example of a Fastcast from two seasons ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hWCizeisY)

If you want one concise place to see most of these, /u/efitz11 has been amazing the last few seasons and posted video links to every game recap and fastcast in the daily Around the Horn thread. [Here's an example.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/992tep/general_discussion_around_the_horn_82118/e4kfyr3/?st=jtbm738k&amp;sh=24d221b5) I am unsure if they plan to continue it this year, but it would be surely appreciated!

#TL;DR Finding what you enjoy about the game.

When it boils down to it, baseball is about finding entertainment and enjoyment, and don't let anyone try to tell you how to enjoy baseball. If you want nothing to do with statistical analysis and just want to enjoy what's going on on the field, don't let anyone tell you you aren't enough of a fan, and if you want to dissect a player into their strengths and components using statcast and advanced metrics don't let anyone tell you you're reading into the game too much. You can follow one team, and only one team, or you can follow multiple teams, don't let anyone tell you you're not a true fan for wearing another team's gear or enjoying their games. You might enjoy bat flips and flamboyance, or reserved speedy home run trots. You might not even enjoy physically watching a game (especially not if your team isn't playing), but find yourself loving keeping track of your team through the season and tracking your players or maybe just the thrill of the standings race and scoreboard watching or maybe you just love all the numbers that get thrown around and arguing about their relevancy. That's okay, eventually I believe enjoyment of the game itself will come, but even if it doesn't, the long baseball season is still creating a place of enjoyment for you, *and that's what matters*. If you have any questions, once again, feel free to ask them in our daily Around the Horn thread, or below in the comments, or if you really want to feel free to PM with questions and I'd be happy to answer.

So watch games this week and join in the discussion here, you'll naturally find yourself gravitating towards certain players or teams and enjoying different aspects of the game. Baseball is a long season, find what you enjoy, stick to it, dwell on it, and enjoy it.

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| Anyone who knows the Trop knows Fergs, the magical land connected by underpass to the cathedral itself. I believe it meets the 7 requirements for life. Movement - in the style of plants, the layout shifts to accomodate events. Respiration - it's basically outdoors but still has cooling systems to filter air. Excretion - all that bar and patron waste has to go somewhere. Growth - this veritable shantytown has clearly expanded itself, every time I go there's something new. Sensitivity - some parts move when touched and return when left alone, such as the stairs. Reproduction - though not franchised, I believe the (listed) 11 sections function as a colony of organisms, the others had to spawn from somewhere. If you've imagined it, Fergs probably has it. Also the Rays won 6 games this week, 5 against first place teams. |**48-21**
**2**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**0**| Well if you are going to be the best you have to beat the best and while the series was competitive the Rangers lost 2 of the 3 games against the Rays. With deGrom officially out for Tommy John guys like Eovaldi, Gray, and Perez will have to carry the load for this pitching staff. Bullpen minus one Spencer Howard has been improving lately which has been nice. |**41-24**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| One of the most encouraging weeks in terms of results in a long time. We swept the Mets in spectacular fashion and took the series from the gnats. 5-1 on the week and our starting rotation didn't even have a great week. Good teams find a way to win. We are a good team. |**40-26**
**4**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+2**| Well last week when I wrote about the upcoming schedule, I said I hoped we would go 4-2, we went 4-2. I'll be honest, I looked at Sundays lineup and thought it was not even close to a winning lineup. Then O'Hearn in the cleanup spot went 3 for 3 with a HR, Hicks continued to rake going 2 for 4 with 2 doubles, Urias went 4 for 5 with 2 doubles and Josh Lester went 2 for 4 with 2 RBI. Henderson seemed to get more confident in the leadoff spot and hit a 462 ft HR yesterday that one bounced the warehouse. I know the fan base is really pulling for a huge move at the deadline (Bieber, Cease, Stroman) and those would be big, but I think they might get more worth out of someone like Paul Blackburn, which would not cost nearly as much capital. Just a thought. 3rd best record in all baseball 60+ games in. It might be a fun summer. |**41-24**
**5**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+4**| The Snakes didn't lose a game all week, taking two games from the Nationals before having the third postponed, and then sweeping the Tigers in Detroit. The offense, defense, and baserunning is all good as hell, but the starting pitching is still a queestion mark going forward, as even the NL's best pitcher by fWAR, Zac Gallen, is having a rough stretch.  |**41-25**
**6**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| A rough start to the month for the Dodgers, losing 4 of their last 5 series including back to back walkoff losses to the Reds, leaving them 3.5 games back from the sneks. Kershaw and Bobby Miller have been keeping the team afloat as of late being probably the only consistent pitchers on the team recently. Thor has a ""blister"" on his finger and is on the IL. I mean I feel bad for the guy but he really just didn't have it and should not be on the mound (ERA of 7.16 on the season). P.S. Bobby Miller is the new hot rookie Dodger and you should watch him pitch.  |**37-29**
**7**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-3**| Where is Yordan? Is he safe? Is he alright? I'd like to be spoiled with a healthy team again. I will say, it's been interesting watching the collective fanbase melt down over not being a total juggernaut this year for the first time since 2016 ish. I'm not sure we know how to act when times are hard anymore.  |**37-29**
**8**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-1**| This offense becomes painful to watch without Aaron Judge, and the Yankees have taken back-to-back series losses as a result. The division just seems to keep getting tougher and tougher, especially with the Blue Jays surging again. Dropping 2/3 to Boston didnt help that. Anemic offense aside, the pitching has stayed consistently very good, and it may be getting even better with Carlos Rodon *actually* expected to begin a rehab assignment soon.  |**38-29**
**9**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| Solid week for the Jays. I believe we have a better future than Reddit, which is saying... well, very little. Took 3 of 4 from the defending champstros before stealing just one in a frustrating series vs MIN after the most clutch 3-run HR ever was hit by Cavan Biggio. (Can that be right...? checks notes Wow. Okay.) We sent our troubled big boy Manoah down to our grandparents' house in Florida after he gave up 6 runs in 0.1 innings, removed a fake Christian bigot tumor named Anthony Bass, and saw Jose Berrios continue his surprisingly shocking return to solid form. This season has fit an entire Taylor Swift relationship's worth of drama into the first two months, and I, for one, want things to calm the fuck down. Series incoming @ Our Bird Bros and @ the Texas Yee-Haws. |**37-30**
**10**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+4**| Zach Neto is a perfect rebound-relationship guy. He seems perfectly fine at face value, but then you get to spending time with him. Time that passes without you even feeling it. Day in and day out he's there for you, checking in with a wake-up text -- surprising you with some Cane's after a tough day at work. Sometimes you have to stop youself and take notice, how did you find such a guy? Is he the product of low expectations brought upon by tragic heartbreak? No, he's just a guy who does the little things well and handles the big moments with grace. Is...is this turning into something more?  |**37-31**
**11**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-1**| The two biggest flaws of the team so far are that we're the most strikeout-prone team in the majors, and we're great at losing close games. Even though we were swept by the Rays, the games were at least competitive. The lineup *finally* showed signs of life in Toronto though and won that series, so hopefully we're about to pick up steam. |**33-33**
**12**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**+5**|  |**37-30**
**13**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**0**| Andrew McCutchen got his 2,000th hit, Mitch Keller finally had a good start after a few rough outings in a row, and Ke'Bryan Hayes appears to be heating up at the plate. The Bucs may have lost 2 of 3 to the A's this week, but the team ahead of them in the standings on Friday got swept by Oakland and now the Pirates are back in first place. The Athletics might be leading the division if they played in the NL Central, but they don't  which means the upstart Bucs are holding onto that spot for now.  |**34-30**
**14**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-3**|  |**34-32**
**15**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+3**| The Giants had a nice 4 -2 week because were pretending Monday and Tuesdays game havent happened yet. A sweep of the Rockies, before dropping 2 of 3 to the Cubs. But hey, they always say if youre gonna win one game in a series -- make it the last one. Momentum. Ah shit, Hanniger and JD possibly IL. Wait Im not supposed to know about that. IM FROM THE FUTURE AND ALL MY NEWS IS BAD. Except the Giants are in the process of winning on the road. Guess who has two thumbs and is currently on a plane? Luis Matos. Presumably. I really dont know how many thumbs he has. |**34-32**
**16**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-4**| The past two weeks have been particularly painful for Boston, featuring a lot of bad BABIP luck for our already slumping offense alongside a slew of embarassing goofs and/or gaffes on defense. The pitching has been slightly better, only giving up 4.3 runs/game in June compared to 5.0 in April/May, but the bats need to be on point if you want to be competitive with mediocre pitching. The Sox have been .500 fifteen times this season (at 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 30, 31, 32, and 33 wins/losses), and it seems like that's where we'll stay without Story/Sale in the mix. But hey, we took 2/3 from the Yankees in New York, that's a win right? |**33-34**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+2**| The Padres havent lost any of their last four seriess, so thats good, right? Blake Snell has been genuinely good his last four starts, with only 2 earned runs in 24 innings. He seems to do this every year; starting slow, and building as the season goes on. Padres hose the Guardians for a series, then the mighty Rays, as they try to keep up with DBacks&who are leading the division?? |**31-34**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| 2-3 on the week - better than last week, but that's a cold comfort. They're not quite at the point of needing another 14-game win streak to get back in it, but time is starting to run out. It's also looking more and more likely that the M's won't have a single starter at the All-Star Game they're hosting. Up next: 3 vs. Florida Men (NL), 3 vs. Bleached Socks |**32-33**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+2**| What a great week it was to be a Phillies fan! After getting swept by the Mets and losing the series opener to the Nationals, the season looked grim. Then, the Phillies won 7 of 8 including a sweep of the Tigers and 2/3 from the Dodgers. Taijuan Walker, Aaron Nola, and Zack Wheeler all had incredible starts in the Tigers series, with Nola and Wheeler entering the 7th and 8th innings respectively with no-hitters. Kyle Schwarber hit another 2 dingers including a walkoff, while Trea Turner finally looked like himself, raising his OPS 45 points this week. Alec Bohm and Jose Alvarado both returned from brief IL stints, while Darick Hall and Cristian Pache both are finishing up rehab assignments. I seem to say it most weeks but Nick Castellanos continues to be the Phillies best hitter, with his OPS 162 points higher than last year. This week, a west coast road trip with 4 in Arizona and 3 against the red hot Oakland Athletics. |**32-34**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| I look at three factors when determining my rankings: record, run differential, and how a team has done against teams over 500. There are A LOT of teams under 500. Anyway, the Guardians haven't been doing badly lately. They've won four of their last five series and split the other one. Are they turning the corner? Or am I just getting false hope? You never know with baseball. |**31-34**
**21**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-5**| It's over. We are back. It's so over. We are so back. It's fucking over. We are fucking back. It's so fucking over. We are so fucking back. It never even began. We never left. |**31-35**
**22**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| Elly De La Cruz has come and so have I. Call your doctor cause this puppy is lasting a lot longer than 4 hours. Seriously can someone please call my doctor, its been 4 days now and I have to go to my kids baseball game tomorrow. Anyway, Elly De La Cruz is here to absolve us of all our sins. He has cometh into our homes to wash away all transgressions and deliver unto us our time of wonder. For Elly De La Cruz is him, he is the prophet set to save us all from the clutches of the Catellini's and lead us into salvation. Elly De La Cruz has brought onto us good baseball and fun, something that has been absent for years. Oh glorious days, Hallelujah we are saved. And god said on the fourth day let there be Elly and there was. And he said on the fifth day let there speed, and Elly gained speed. And he said on the sixth day let there be power, and Elly gained power. He hath flown down from the heavens and blessed thee. He reached out to touch thee and emanating from thine finger was the holy spirit, upon contact Cincinnati witnessed miracles of divine proportion. And Elly asked if thee had been saved and thee responded lord yes thine have. And Elly floated back to the palace of God and it rained for forty days and forty nights, and when the waters subsided there was but only joy. Elly De La Cruz has arrived.   |**32-35**
**23**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-1**| Fresh off of a week that showed promise, the Cubs squandered it by going 2-5. Kyle Hendricks' no hit bid was a pleasant surprise, but the day was marred by reports that the Cubs FO wasn't involved in extension talks with Marcus Stroman. |**28-37**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-1**| Fire John Mozeliak. |**27-40**
**25**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**+1**| The White Sox were on pace to win both series of the week en route to a 4-2 record. Then, two relievers who hadn't given up a run since APRIL both imploded in the 8th and 9th and blew a 5-1 lead. Just emblamatic of this team, who also placed Hendriks on the IL Sunday with elbow inflamation. |**29-38**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Given the big club is relatively poopy, let's take a look at JAMES WOOD JAMES WOOD JAMES WOOD. Dude is a giant OF at 6'7 and is heating up in AA Harrisburg. He's currently hitting 11-37 with 7XBH (4-2B and 3-HR) and made a spectacular catch up against the fence in CF. There's still some swing &amp; miss in his game, but he's exciting for sure. |**26-38**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**+1**| The Rockies went 1-5 this week, including multiple games where the bullpen blew a lead late, but it ended with Ryan McMahon and Nolan Jones hitting some of the longest homers this year so I'm kind of in a good mood for the moment. |**28-40**
**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**-3**| 0-for-June, yikes. As the outfield injuries keep racking up, the rest of the lineup is nowhere to be found. Can't really say anything positive about the big squad, but at least it looks like Tarik Skubal's return is coming soon and he's been racking up punchies in his rehab starts. Finally something to look forward to! This week: 3 vs. ATL, 4 at MIN. |**27-37**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| *Note from Jack: Please consider donating to your local food bank, animal shelter, or worthy nearby charity. Every dollar can help someone in need* |**18-48**

# Teams

**Toronto Blue Jays - AL Wild Card 3**

 - Record: 89-73
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1993
 - Last World Series Win: 1993
 - First Opponent: Minnesota Twins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.5%

The only non-American team are back in the playoffs after surviving a tough AL East. The team known as the Baby Birds aren't exactly babies anymore with their lineup of players with Major League dads all having a few years of experience at this point. Vlad Jr. took a minor step back this year but Brandon Belt's resurgence at age 35 has buoyed a solid offence. The Jays will look to AL Strike Out leader Kevin Gausman to get them out to a good start with the rest of the rotation and bullpen providing an excellent follow up.

**Texas Rangers - AL Wild Card 2**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2016
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2011
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1961, moved to Texas 1972)
 - First Opponent: Tampa Bay Rays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 4.7%

The Rangers are looking to rebound from a cool finish to the season - a hot start that led to a 6 game lead for the division in June fell to a tough division race in August before a seeming resurgence gave them a 2.5 game lead with 4 games left to play that turned into a second place finish. For Rangers fandom, this is about exorcising playoff demons that have haunted them since being one strike away twice in 2011, the team hasn't won a playoff series since. The Rangers star has been Corey Seager who slashed a ridiculous .327/.390/.623 over the season to bounce back from a disappointing 2021 that looked like he wouldn't be worth the massive contract he got.

**Tampa Bay Rays - AL Wild Card 1**

 - Record: 99-63
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1998)
 - First Opponent: Texas Rangers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.0%

The Rays were the hottest team in baseball to start the season sitting at 23-6 at the end of April. A July slump of 8-16 cost the team the division, but the Rays rebounded to finish the year with a good record. Next man up has been the name of the game as injuries (and a major legal scandal of star which we won't get into) have proven that the Rays can just pull someone up from the minors to plug into whatever gaps they have. When healthy almost every bat in the lineup is well above average, with first baseman Yandy Diaz having the biggest bat of them all. The team is also fleet of feet, 2nd in the AL in stolen bases with 160 led by Josh Lowe's 32. And with news of a new stadium on the horizon that keeps the team in Tampa Bay area (albeit in St. Pete), expect fans to be fully behind the team. Despite all that, all eyes will likely be on 2020 breakout star and 2023 World Baseball Classic hero Randy Arozarena who seems to always deliver when the moment is big.

**Minnesota Twins - AL Central Champions**

 - Record: 87-75
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1991
 - Last World Series Win: 1991
 - First Opponent: Toronto Blue Jays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 2.0%


The Twins coasted through most of September after taking 2 of 3 from the Guardians at the beginning of the month to solidify their hold on the worst division in baseball and despite that come into the wild card round with some injury questions. Superstar shortstop Carlos Correa (who has had a disappointing year at the plate) hasn't played in over a week, electric center fielder Byron Buxton (who is made of glass and also has had a disappointing year at the plate) hasn't played since August 1st, and rookie grand slam sensation Royce Lewis (who may also be made of glass) tweaked a hamstring the second to last week of the season and may be relegated to DH only. On the flip side, the bullpen gained back some of it's best arms late with returns from the IL from Brock Stewart, Caleb Thielbar, and Chris Paddack - along with Kenta Maeda moving to the pen means the bullpen should be better than the season numbers indicate. With all of that said, those storylines take a back seat to the big one - the franchise is on an 18 game playoff losing streak, the longest in professional sport history.

**Houston Astros - AL West Champions**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Win: 2022
 - First Opponent: Winner of Blue Jays/Twins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 19.8%


The Astros snatched the division championship on the last day of the season, disappointing millions of people who are still upset about the 2017 sign stealing scandal and/or are just tired of seeing the Astros in the playoffs. Houston is the current AL dynasty and has played in the last 6 ALCSs and 3 of the last 6 World Series. 2023 was the worst regular season for the team since the 2016 season, but the biggest bats and hardest throwers from last year's championship team are back this year and still major threats even with some minor steps back statistically. Don't expect Yordon Alvarez to get a pitch with hit with runners in scoring position if the opposing team wants to win.

**Baltimore Orioles - AL East Champions**

 - Record: 101-61
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2016
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1983
 - Last World Series Win: 1983
 - First Opponent: Winner of Rangers/Rays
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.3%

The breakout team of the year - while many thought they arrived two years early last year in their surprise winning season following a 110 loss 2021, most thought they would take a minor step forward and 2024 would be the real deal. The Orioles players did not agree. Excellent bullpen usage and key hits kept this team cruising through the year. Solid hitters up and down the lineup without elite mashers (though Adley Rutschman does set a high bar for a catcher), Kyle Bradish anchors a solid rotation - the team is an exemplary example of the team as a whole being more than the sum of the parts. The team is young (only one player over the age of 30 played in 100 games), hungry, and ready to prove that this team is set to take over the AL for years to come.

**Arizona Diamondbacks - NL Wild Card 3**

 - Record: 84-78
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2017
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2001
 - Last World Series Win: 2001
 - First Opponent: Milwaukee Brewers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 3.6%

A likely Rookie of the Year campaign from Corbin Carroll and great years from starters Merrill Kelly and Zac Gallen was enough to push the Diamondbacks into the postseason for the first time since 2017. The team is only two years removed from a disastrous 110 loss season and while they aren't nearly to the level of their 2021 AL counterpart Orioles, the team still has the pieces to make some noise. Look for lots of movement on the basepaths from the D-Backs, they finished second in baseball in stolen bases and the most of anyone in the playoff field. 

**Miami Marlins - NL Wild Card 2**

 - Record: 84-77
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2003
 - Last World Series Win: 2003
 - First Opponent: Philadelphia Phillies
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 2.3%

The Marlins haven't had a winning season in a full year since 2009, and their only playoff appearance since their 2003 World Series run was in the covid shortened 2020 season. The offense is Luis Arraez hitting for average like no one else, and Jorge Soler providing the power, with a solid rotation that keeps them in games. They are the only playoff team with a negative run differential and are looking to show that winning close games is a skill that can translate to the postseason. Despite the potential slights, major credit needs to be given to GM Kim Ng, the first female GM in major North American professional sports, for finding the pieces to survive a division with the buzzsaw Braves and find a way into the playoffs.

**Philadelphia Phillies - NL Wild Card 1**

 - Record: 90-72
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Win: 2008
 - First Opponent: Miami Marlins
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 6.9%

The 2022 NL Champions and World Series runner ups knew it would be a tough road in the division with the Braves, but they managed to push their way through to a 90 win season and snatch the top wild card spot. After an atrocious start to the season, Trea Turner has turned it around to close out the year, and Bryce Harper is ready to lead this team in another deep postseason run. Of course, it'd be remiss to talk about the Phillies without talking about one of the more interesting stat lines in baseball - Kyle Schwarber batting .197 and still managed to be a major offensive plus with 47 homers and 126 walks. Prime time coverage will be on Philly during the wild card round, and the stadium is set to be just as raucous as last year.

**Milwaukee Brewers - NL Central Champions**

 - Record: 92-70
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2021
 - Last World Series Appearance: 1982
 - Last World Series Win: Never (enfranchised 1969, moved to Milwaukee 1970)
 - First Opponent: Arizona Diamondbacks
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 3.9%

Pitching is the name of the game for the Brewers with a stellar bullpen and a playoff rotation of sub 4 ERA pitchers - they have the lowest runs allowed per game of playoff teams. Christian Yelich bounced back from a poor showing in 2022 to be above average, though not nearly to his elite levels of prior years, and William Contreres brought production from behind the dish. Surprisingly, the main characters of this team's run aren't the ones on the field, though. Manager Craig Counsell has been at the helm since 2015 and is the winningest manager in team history and one of the most respected managers in the game, but with his contract up at the end of the year it sounds like he's ready to take a step back and ride off into the sunset. In addition, long time announcer Bob Uecker turns 90 this offseason and there are always question of how long he'll be able to continue. This gives some added urgency to win now for a city that hasn't seen a World Series win since the 1957 Braves.

**Los Angeles Dodgers - NL West Champions**

 - Record: 100-62
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2020
 - Last World Series Win: 2020
 - First Opponent: Winner of Diamondbacks/Brewers
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 17.6%

The Dodgers are riding into their 11th straight postseason with their 5th 100 win season in that time (6th if you include the 100+ win pace shortened 2020). Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman would with MVP favorites if not for a certain Braves player, and Clayton Kershaw is still throwing to a sub 3 ERA. The team has the pieces and playoff experience to make a deep run - which we have said about them for the last decade. Yet the only ring in that time was in the shortened 2020 season - a asterisk in some people's eyes that the team and fanbase is ready shake with a title this year.

**Atlanta Braves - NL East Champions**

 - Record: 104-58
 - Last Playoff Appearance: 2022
 - Last World Series Appearance: 2021
 - Last World Series Win: 2021
 - First Opponent: Winner of Marlins/Phillies
 - Fangraphs' World Series%: 20.4%

They built a deathstar by locking up young talent on long term contracts, they added the best catcher on the market this year, and then they sat back and watched Ronald Acuna Jr. use and abuse the new rules to steal 73 bases (the most in a single season since 2007) to go with a 41 home run campaign. The team tied the single season team record for home runs in a season with 307 with a team slugging over .500. The Atlanta Braves are easily the favorites to win the 2023 World Series and have all the pieces to keep their division titles streak going beyond the 6 they currently have.","baseball",68,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/16xwx9z/the_2023_mlb_playoffs_survival_guide/"

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| This week was nothing special for [the Rays](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/038/456/669/original/noel-bellett-project-mantaray-gif-01.gif?1623153356) as they kept up their normal ~.800 win percentage. Just your normal, [pimping a putout](https://www.mlb.com/video/chase-anderson-in-play-out-s-to-bryan-reynolds-rebasl), walking off the Yankees, sweeping the best NL team, warm water kind of week. I'm sure you're familiar. This week is a full slate against the AL East, let's hope the trends continue. |**28-7**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| 6-2 including series wins against the Mets and the Orioles. Really nice week. Getting healthier and healthier. This team can win in so many ways. We get a couple of rest days this week, which come at a good time with multiple players returning from the IL. Keep it going. |**24-11**
**3**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+6**|  |**21-14**
**4**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| The offense is going to win a lot of games for the club this year. The starting pitchers are going to win a lot of games for the club this year. The bullpen is going to blow a lot of those games this year. We're having fun though. |**20-13**
**5**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**| This'll be short, as I'm in Hawaii for my birthday. We did real, real bad against the Red Sox and real, real good against the Pirates. Matt Chapman. Chris Bassitt. Whit Merrifield. Baseball. Mahalo.  |**21-14**
**6**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**+1**| I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the games over the weekend against the Braves. Won the first one and seriously had a chance to win the next two. Bullpen was a little off and some mistakes were made, however having the chance to win 3 games in Atlanta against a really good team shows the Orioles might be for real after all. They are still, let's say, one year ahead of schedule, so there are still a lot of growing pains. Hitting with runners in scoring position is not consistent, there are 3 catchers on the roster for some reason and there is a huge logjam in the infield. I would think the biggest concern right now is Gunnar Henderson. The consensus pre-season ROTY favorite in the AL is batting .176 in 29 games. Yes, he walks, and his defense is good, but right now he looks lost at the plate. There are other prospects crushing it in AAA and the Cardinals sent Jordan Walker down to work things out and he was hitting .274. Look he is 21 years old, and the game is hard. It wouldn't be the worst thing if he gets sent down to figure a couple of things out. Big series against Tampa Bay starts today. |**22-12**
**7**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+11**| Well, losing to the Phillies the day before power rankings makes this a bit less sweet, but still FUCK THAT 8 GAME WIN STREAK INCLUDING A SWEEP OF TORONTO LETS GOOOOO! Somehow playing center field for Boston bestows the power of baseball gods onto whatever old player you throw out there. 34 year old Adam Duvall? 1.030 slugging in 37 PAs. Formerly-hyped-but-now-kinda-washed prospect Jarren Duran? Called up and immediately starts raking in hits, .366 average in 20 games. Hopefully we can keep the momentum rolling for a two game set in Atlanta. |**21-15**
**8**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-4**| Milwaukee has lost 6 of the previous 7 games they've played, yet somehow they are still only 0.5 games out of first.  I'm definitely scratching my head.     Rookie 2B Brice Turang has haad a heck of a week slashing .467/.556/.533 and Christian Yelich might be making me eat a bit of crow hitting .308 since I mentioned him last week. |**19-15**
**9**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**|  |**19-16**
**10**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-2**| It's crazy that the Astros just suddenly stopped playing on Saturday night and the game was canceled. Don't think that's ever happened before. The team doesn't look too great right now and pitching injuries continue to pile up, with Luis Garcia as the latest victim. Hope is on the horizon, though: Brantley and McCormick are expected back this week, and Altuve is apparently close to starting a rehab assignment.  |**17-17**
**11**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+2**| As fun as it was to see Tatis bop two homers off Kershaw on Friday, its hard to call the series anything but a disappointment, losing 2 / 3 vs LA, with Hader giving up the game tying homer to Mookie Betts, and the Pads losing in the 10th. Still, Im squinting my eyes a bit, and noticing that over the last two weeks; Manny has an Ops of .970, Tatis has been doing well since hes started the season, and even Cronenworths bat has picked up a bit in the same time frame. Its not great to be just in the middle of the pack right now, but I still think theres plenty of room for optimism. Its gonna take a bit before the allure of getting to watch Bogaerts, Tatis, Manny, and Soto all in the same lineup wear off.  |**18-17**
**12**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-6**| The Pirates may be improved from 2022, but they're not ready to hang with MLB's best teams quite yet. After scoring 16 runs in a game against the Nationals on April 29, the Pirates have scored a total of 9 runs since then  and the pitching and defense haven't been so hot either. Sweeps at the hands of the Rays and Blue Jays make it 7 straight losses for the Bucs, and I shudder to think how many games this team would've lost the last couple of years had they played in the AL East.   |**20-15**
**13**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+3**| After sweeping a rather hapless Cardinals team, the Angels scored some runs against the Rangers, but gave up a lot more. They allowed 13 runs in the 7th inning or later in the series, a bit more specifically. While the bullpen has settled in some, posting the 9th best ERA in baseball among bullpens, they are also 9th in baseball in meltdowns. It's clear the team could use another arm - or two with the injuries - to really shore things up.  |**19-16**
**14**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks had a good week by the W/L numbers, but failed to capitalize against a very bad Washington team and let a sweep slip through the fingers. The pitching continues to be an issue.  |**19-15**
**15**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-3**| A series win in Tampa would have been huge for a struggling Yankees team, and it was surprisingly a very real possibility. Tampas a tough team to beat pepper in some classic Aaron Boone bullpen bungling, a couple costly errors, and the first bad start of Coles season, and youll drop *at least* 2/3 every time. All that aside, the offense actually showed flashes of competency this week. With Judge due back Tuesday, hopefully this is a get right series vs. Oakland.  |**18-17**
**16**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-2**|  |**17-17**
**17**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-6**| The Mets have played 8 times since my last update and lost 6 times, including a sweep in Detroit and a series loss against the Rockies at home. They are now under .500. Verlander had a solid Mets debut but Scherzer was absolutely torched in his return from suspension - bumping his ERA up to 5.56 on the year. The team heads into another week that should be easy on paper - with series against the Reds and Nationals - if they once again fail to deliver, they'll be looking even more like paper tigers than they already do. |**17-18**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**+2**| A 5-1 week vs. two division rivals and the Mariners are finally back to .500 - hopefully a good sign of things to come. Bryce Miller is here and doing pretty great thus far, and the team is slowly starting to pick up their hitting. Oh, and the City Connect unis are out now, I guess (though really they should just make the Turn Ahead the Clock unis a permanent fixture.) Up next: 3 vs. Walker, Texas Rangers, 3 @ Beisbolcats |**17-17**
**19**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-2**| Bryce Harper's return saw the move to have Kyle Schwarber hit lead-off like he did in the postseason last year. He proceeded to go 0-19 as the Phillies lost their next 4 to cap a 6 game losing streak. Yay. On the plus side, Stott was moved back to leadoff on Sunday and the Phillies won while Schwarber went 2-3 with a home run. Baseball. Bryce Harper is back and better than ever, and Ranger Suarez should be returning this week. The pitching was atrocious, giving up 36 runs in a 3 game series to the Dodgers while bouncing back for 13 in 3 against the Red Sox. Hopefully it's just a blip in what's been a great season for the bullpen so far, but the starters continue to struggle. Even with Suarez returning and Painter potentially later in the season, the Phillies likely need starting pitching help more than anything. This week: a short two game series against the Blue Jays at home before heading to Coors for 3. Go Sixers |**16-19**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-1**| The Guardians actually won a series this week! I'm hoping this is the beginning of things turning around, but I am still concerned. We aren't getting enough hits or runs, and the pitchers have given up a lot of hits and runs. Crap, that sounded bad. We also blow early leads a lot. I probably shouldn't be complaining. |**16-18**
**21**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+2**| The Giants took a series @ Houston and vs the Brewers, turning in what was easily the best week of the year. You are allowed to feel happy this Monday and I encourage it because it sounds more fun than hungover which I currently am. |**15-18**
**22**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| Im sick and tired of the marlins playing the braves and mets. The braves smacked us yet again and we dropped a series to the cubs after winning a series against chitown last week in miami. thankfully, sandy seems to be trending back up and we know which bullpen arms are gonna be dependable or not. Jazz is somewhat concerning at the plate to start the season but there is plenty of baseball left this year. We got 3 against the sneks in the desert and 3 at home against the reds this week. |**17-18**
**23**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+3**| Interesting development yesterday as the Tigers demoted Spencer Turnbull, who's struggled to find his footing coming back from Tommy John surgery. This streaky team (seriously, look at their game log) has had a few more ups than downs recently and is surprisingly sitting in the middle of the AL Central, 3 games out of first place (don't expect this to continue). Last week was fun watching the returns- and losses- of Verlander and Scherzer to CoPa while wearing the wrong colors. This week: 3 at CLE, 3 vs. SEA. |**15-18**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-2**| The Cards went 1-5, dodging 3 straight sweeps. Sure, they could still turn it around. YCPB. But the situation with Contreras while the team is 11-24 has provided final clarity on John Mozeliak. He's no savant doing his best with what ownership gives him. He's the rot at the core, surviving off a decade of blind luck and generational talents compensating for his endless mistakes. Matheny, Shildt, Marmol. What's the common factor? It's John Mozeliak. Time's up. He and everyone like him in the org must go. |**11-24**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**-1**| Sometimes I just want to watch baseball and have fun. You know, waking up like this every day can be stress inducing, I just want to drag myself out of bed half asleep and go to work to suffer through a miserable day of mediocrity and come home to watch some fun baseball to unwind. That's all I want. But nooooooo, I had to be unfortunate enough to become a Reds fan so I'm just constantly miserable. Sometimes life just works out that way huh? Sometimes you're sitting at a red light and the radio is playing some s**t song from someone you've never heard of named Lexi Nova or something and you think ""Gee this sounds terrible, who would ever listen to this"" and you look around and see a bunch of young people nodding their head to rhythem in the surrounding cars, so oh I guess that's who listens to it, what do they understand about it that I don't? And the song is over after like 2 verses because those same young people need it to make some dumb tik tok or whatever and good god I've been sitting at this red light for like 5 minutes now there's nothing coming why hasn't it turned green yet I'm gonna be late to work. Sometimes life just works that way. You could be sitting at home with the wife and you're arguing because her Dad is being a dick about who's gonna get the house between his 4 children and I personally don't care because his house is like 70 years old and the amount of money to fix it to modern standards is gonna basically the same if we were to just remodel it entirely so what's even the point anyway? And my wife's like ""You never even liked my dad all that much"" which yeah that's partially true, but I pretended because I loved her, and I'm all like ""This isn't about your dad, I'm not sure why you're upset"" and then she tells me ""You've been way too distant, I want you back"". You know sometimes life just works out like that, you're stuck in a soul draining job because you were too lazy to get good grades in high school and you got stuck doing GEDs at a community college that you're now thousands of dollar in debt to. Sometimes it just works like that, and you keep arguing with the wife about how unhappy you are and maybe you should take some time to think things over, we married way too young anyway, I missed out on my prime years because I got in too deep in this relationship which was flawed from the beginning because of our age and now we have a kid I barely spend time with and it's falling apart and I JUST WANT TO RELAX. She storms off to go stay at her Dad's for a bit, I just want to have fun so I turn on the Reds game and they're losing 17-4 Goddammit, f**k f**k f**k. F***k.  |**14-20**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Entering 2023 with a career ERA above 5 is usually not a good sign but Josiah Gray is poving that number to be his past. Gray is currently sporting a 3.03ERA and while his most recent outing at Arizona wasn't the most sparkling of turns (5IP, 3ER), he had 3 Quality Starts in April and has lowered his barrel % to 6.3% (lower than league average 6.8%). He's throwing his slider more and inducing 42% ground balls, much closer to the league average than his previous years in the low 30%. |**14-20**
**27**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| The Rockies went 5-1 this week, sweeping the Brewers and taking 2 of 3 from the Mets, which is good on paper.  This is kind of my least favorite type of week for the current brand of Rockies, because it inevitably means that my dad is going to call me and say something like, ""They're getting hot, maybe they have a chance!"" and I have to pretend like they do until they go on their next .200 winning percentage week and dash his hopes. |**14-21**
**28**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| This week marked the first time the White Sox won 2 games in a row this year and also marked their first series win. They actually won both series this week. Despite that and despite the 17-4 win on Sunday, they are still 11 games below .500 with a run differential of -54. Probably not ideal for a team that was supposed to be in the middle of their contention window. |**12-23**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| John Sherman wants tax dollars for a new stadium, but can't even field a team that can win a series against the A's. The fucking A's. A team whose ownership doesn't give a fuck and isn't trying took two of three from KC. I'd say that's the nadir of the season, but it'll probably get worse. |**9-26**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**|  |**8-27**","baseball",67,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/13c57b0/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_6_a_tale_of/"

The Orioles where consistent winners due to there always being a hot bat or two in the lineup.  They were also pretty much the comeback kings.  Yet they get swept with cold bats and having only once (I think) held a lead.

**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**+6**| Remember last year when the Rays had a disappointing wild card round where offense was a myth? Now that team is healthy and balling the fuck out. Wander decided to use his power stroke, NUKE RALEY has been out here supporting his 2.4 kids, the dawg Brandon Lowe (pronounced Lowe) has returned, Randy is in full confidence mode, Isaac is defying gravity, and really everyone is looking fantastic. Our pitching has been lights out with only 1 notable weak point, which will get filled in by some guy named Ty Glas-Steagall or something. The Rays have entered the realm of 1800s comparisons, even accusations of including barnstorming stats, but who cares! The water is the perfect temperature right now, why wouldn't you dive in? |**9-0**
**2**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+1**| Judge hates the Os, Stanton hates baseballs, the Bombers apparently like stealing bases, and everybody loves Franchy (who wouldve thought?). Pitching looked rock solid again this week (if your name isnt Clarke Schmidt) with two more good starts from Cole and Nestor, plus a couple of filthy outings from Clay Holmes. If the Yanks keep winning 2/3 all year, thats 108 wins which should be more than good enough to grab the wildcard behind the 162-0 Rays. |**6-3**
**3**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**-1**| After a hot start, the Braves ran into a bit of a buzzsaw in the Padres that spolied the home opening series. It also doesn't help that our Cy Young candidate, last year's Rookie of the Year, closer and our best offensive catcher (so far) are all on the IL. Not to mention Kyle Wright and Mike Soroka who are still recovering. If we can shake off the injury bug, we will be fine. Hopefully 2 series with the Reds and then the Royals will be just what the doctor ordered. |**6-4**
**4**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| While many fans were hopeful that Xander Boagarts would hit the ground running, his early exploits may not be as surprising as the Padres debuts of both Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha. Xander is rocking an ops over 1000, while both of those pitchers are rocking eras 3 and under. Its certainly been needed, as Musgrove is still on the mend, and the Padres have more tough competition ahead versus the Mets and BrewCrew. |**6-4**
**5**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| The Dodgers allowed double digit runs only twice in the entire 2022 season. They allowed double digit runs in back to back games against the D-Backs to close this week (which for the record, is partly because Arizona actually looks really good, but still). Considering how much I yammered on about pitching being the backbone of the Dodgers' success last week, I really hope this is just a dumb baseball outlier stat. Still, despite it ending on a sour note, a 3-3 week is not worth burning everything down over. We're still very, very early in the season folks, I will not be jumping to any early conclusions other than declaring James Outman to be the reincarnation of Mickey Mantle.  |**5-5**
**6**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**-5**| Weird week for the Astros. The absence of Altuve and Brantley is certainly being felt and the pitching just hasn't been as sharp as we're used to, aside from Hunter Brown's fantastic performance today against the Twins. Still too early for any major shakeups, though I know half the fanbase is clamoring for Jake Meyers' head on a stick any time he appears in the lineup - especially over Chas McCormick. Also, can someone tell Jeremy Pena we are playing the Yankees or Phillies? Thanks.  |**4-6**
**7**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+6**| I certainly didn't expect to see Milwaukee sweep the Mets (who happen to have triple the total payroll) and taking 2/3 from St Louis is always a happy day for Brewers fans.    The Jesse Winker/Kolten Wong trade is showing really well for Milwaukee to start the season and 3B Brian Anderson is one of the hottest hitters in the NL so far. |**7-2**
**8**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**0**| We need to talk about Jose. After a horribly disappointing '22, Berrios has started '23 with two losses, an 11.17 ERA, 15 hits, all in only 9.2 innings of work. And he's only 2 years into a 7-year deal. This is not great, Bob. Thankfully, the rest of the rotation has mostly rebounded after a rough first go-round, with Manoah and Gausman looking very sharp in games in KC and LAA (I will have nightmares for a long time of Trout arm-muscling massive dingers). Kikuchi still makes you sweat when he's bad, so TBD on him, and our bullpen is still capable of snatching hope away in an instant, like a scientifically enhanced shark snarfing Sam Jackson in the middle of a rousing speech.  What's going really great, Bob, is this offense. 5th-most runs scored in the MLB so far. Springer-Bichette-Vladdy-Chapman-Varsho at the top of the order have been lights out, and the added speed and smart baserunning behind them can erase any deficit at any time. Thankfully, we finally get our home opener today in the newly renovated Rogers Centre. Apologies for what we're about to do to the Tigers. That sets up a big early series against the steamrolling Rays of the Bay of Tampa. At least the first start of that one is being handed to (checks notes)... oh no... |**6-4**
**9**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+5**| It turns out that having a starting rotation of all #2s gets you [the best pitching staff](https://i.gyazo.com/fe5b95e1e99bc686a0e5b7df45d3a7de.jpg) in the majors. Who knew? The bats still need to wake up a bit, but overall it's looking like it will be a very good summer for Minnesota. |**6-3**
**10**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| Nice little 3-3 week from the Shit Goblins, as they took a series from the A's then won the season series against the M's.  At least one strong performance from each starter this week, and Myles Straw continues to impress. |**6-4**
**11**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-5**| **NO BLURB SUBMITTED** |**5-5**
**12**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+4**| This is an Andrew Wantz appreciation post. Why Andrew Wantz? Because he's about the only reliever for the team who has not provided the team with the anthesis of his job title. With 17 batters faced so far, he's allowed one hit and an unearned run with six strikeouts and no walks. Outside of him, the bullpen is posting a gaudy 5.27 ERA. Starting off 5-4 would have sounded fine had you told me on Opening Day, but man, there have been a few wins left on the table so far.  |**5-4**
**13**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**-4**| Positives: Jordan Walker is hitting the hell out of some baseballs. Negatives: Pretty much everything else. But it's the first 9 games and I can't make a narrative at the beginning of April. The Cards are putting runners on, they just gotta score.  |**3-6**
**14**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+1**| After the offensive explosion against the Phillies the offense has come crashing down back to earth and has gone missing some games. After an absolutely awful defensive showing in Chicago guys like Leody Taveras can't get healthier soon enough. Still ending the week over .500 which is neat. |**5-4**
**15**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-4**| Sloppy baseball, sloppy results. Feels like it's been the motto of the season so far. Teo and Kolten have yet to find their footing, but on the bright side, Kelenic has been off to a nice start - can he keep it going? The M's start a long stretch of 5 consecutive interleague series spanning until just about the end of the month, so it'll be an interesting change of pace but also what the heck, schedulers. Up next: 3 @ Chicago Baby Bears, 3 vs. Rocks (Feldspar) |**4-6**
**16**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**-4**| The Phillies are 3-6 but ultimately had a decent week performance wise, losing 2/3 against the Yankees in the Bronx before flipping that result at home agianst the Reds. Factoring out the disastrous opening series, we're doing fine. Darick Hall, however, is not, so the Phillies have been forced to move Alec Bohm to first and start Edmundo Sosa to 3rd. For whatever reason, Cristian Pache has been set up to bat instead of being a late inning defensive/running replacement. Kyle Schwarber has been terrible besides a couple dingers, while Bryson Stott is looking like his potential peak self. Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola both bounced back in their second starts, while Kimbrel, Soto, and Dominguez have left a lot to be desired. The most impressive statline on the Phillies is Jose Alvarado, who has gotten 12 outs on 11 strikeouts while giving up just one hit. This week: three at home against the fish before heading to Cincinnati for the second 4 game series against the Reds on the season. |**3-6**
**17**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+3**| The D-backs took 3 of 4 from the Dodgers after splitting a two-game set in San Diego. Through 10 games, the D-backs stand 6-4 after a brutal early slate of games, all against NL juggernauts Dodgers and Padres. While it's too early to call this team contenders due to some glaring question marks in the rotation, the Snakes have delivered on taking full advantage of the team's strengths--athleticism, defense, and aggressiveness on the basepaths have yielded some exciting, winning baseball so far.  |**6-4**
**18**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+1**| DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERS. THE 2023 BOSTON RED SOX ARE THE GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME. Getting swept by the Pirates was a strategic move to lull other teams into a false sense of security. Starting with their sweep of the Tigers, the Sox have begun what will soon be the greatest winning streak in the history of ~~baseball~~ PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. Say goodbye to that perfect season Tampa... |**5-4**
**19**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Two weeks in and about where I thought the Orioles would be.  The next few series will be the telling tale.  They play their next 12 games against the A's, White Sox, Nationals and Tigers.  Nothing against those teams but if the O's don't go at least 8-4 then there might be more to worry about than we think.  Optioning Kyle Stowers this week was also very confusing because we now have 3 catchers on the active roster, which really doesn't make any sense.  I know the outfield is crowded but with all the other prospects we have at different positions are these younger guys just going to be blocked by people on the roster already? |**4-5**
**20**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+2**| The Cubs went 3-2 this week, splitting a 2 game series in Cincinnati then taking 2 out of 3 from the Rangers. They are a maddeningly inconsistent team in the early going, as the lineup and rotation are all or nothing. In the rotation, Marcus Stroman and Justin Steele have excelled but the other 3 starters have a combined ERA of 7.85. The schedule stiffens up significantly in the coming weeks, as 13 of their next 16 games are against the Dodgers, Mariners, and Padres.  |**4-4**
**21**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| The Giants lost a series to a good team, won a series vs a solid team, and lost a series against a bad team. Quick takeaways: Disco is crushing it, Manaea is good?,  theyre hitting and giving up homers, theyre playing close games, Hanniger, Slater, and Bart will join the team shortly, and theyve only had one significant injury, Perez, who is one of the Giants approximately 47 catchers. Lets look at the numbers: 13th in MLB in Run Diff, the Giants are in a healthy spot. 9th in RS / G, 19th in RA / G, 25th in Bullpen ERA  I think we can see where the early problem is. The pen will absolutely not be this bad so look for likely improvement, all around, on the pitching side. Up next is a series vs the Dodgers, one of only 2 at home all year because of Manfred, and absolutely neither fanbase has any clue what will happen. In this weeks Who and Why Are You? we take a closer look at new Giant [Sean Manaea](https://i.imgur.com/J8MAiPm.png). |**4-5**
**22**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-5**| After a somewhat hopeful 1st series against the Astros, the White Sox immediately imploded at home. Michael Kopech was apparently tipping his pitches and gave up 4 homers in an inning to the Giants. Eloy managed to get on the IL less than 1 week into the season. All fan bases need to remember to chant, ""It's still early,"" and Sox fans especially. The team has been hitting, but the pitching has been truly awful. Hopefully they can turn things around behind their hitting. |**4-6**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**+3**| Oneil Cruz fractured his ankle, and the light has gone out of my life. |**6-3**
**24**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**-1**| The marlins still got a few questions marks at starter and in the BP but at least sandy and luzardo are still on point (seriously, Mel stottlemeyer is worth every penny of his contract). I def see some arms being called up from the minors sooner rather than later. on offense, there ain't as many questions marks but that's just cuz the lack of power was expected. When we hit the ball we usually hit it well, getting runs is a different story tho. Still waaaaay too many men LOB. Expect to see a decent amount of call-ups on defense and offense in the next month or so for the Fish. This week we got a series in Philly and we close the weekend out against the sneks at home. |**4-6**
**25**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**0**|  |**4-4**
**26**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-2**| First off, I'd like to thank kasutori_Jack for the opportunity to represent the Rockies. This week the Rockies got swept in a two game series on the road by the Dodgers and split a four game series at home to the Nationals, which isn't great, but about as good as I expected them to be.  I truly think the highlight of the year at the end of the season might be a rare 1-0 win during our home opener.  Big congratulations to CJ Cron on winning player of the week, though. |**4-6**
**27**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Is a 3-7 record ideal? Nope. However, the Royals are hitting the ball hard and the pitching has generally been solid. They just don't have anything to show for it. If the bats continue hitting the ball hard, those hits will come. And if the pitching is actually this solid, the Royals could be respectable. |**3-7**
**28**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**0**| This week had me looking for the top 2024 MLB Draft options. I think it's going to be a long season. At least Akil Baddoo is back? Yeah, not too much to get overly excited about. I promise I won't be so negative all season long. This week: 3 at TOR, 3 vs. SFG. |**2-7**
**29**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**+1**| It's never too early to get hyped for some SSS output so that's what we're going to do. Let me tell you about 2023 All-Star Starting CF Victor Robles who is currently sporting a .924 OPS and is walking more than he's striking out - just stepping into the Bryce Harper and Juan Soto sized ""generational OF talent"" shoes. |**3-7**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**-1**| The A's have been outscored 39-24 this year and have looked immedaitely improved from last year's squad... if you ignore three blowouts where they were bested 35-1 and looked as bad as the franchise has been in decades. This year, injuries to two starters have exposed depth and the bullpen just regressed. Not to mention, Fujinami and his agent, Mr. Boras, absolutely insist that he's a starter (he is a reliever). But he can only pitch once a week! The defense is shakier than expected (worst in baseball so far) as the team decided to sacrifise what was a top-10 defense for slightly more hitting power. At least half of the dudes in the lineup will probably stick around for the electrifying upcoming September run, and Laureano is healthy so far. |**2-7**","baseball",68,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12hwr5v/2023_rbaseball_power_rankings_week_2_tampa_bay/"

The Colorado Rockies really are the kiss of death when it comes to the Hall of Fame. People may have thought Larry Walker broke the curse beset upon that franchise by getting elected, but not so. It appears that event only signaled that the weight that a ""Rockies"" cap attaches to the cases of those who wear it is still the heaviest in the MLB. Todd Helton should have been elected years ago, but because his team's home field was in Denver for his entire career, he's still on the outside looking in. Brian Fuentes, who leads the franchise with 115 career saves and who rocked Colorado colors at the All-Star game no fewer than three times, was left off the ballot despite 12 years of MLB service. The weight has other proof to its existence as well, as Bret Saberhagen, who became a Rockie at age 31 and could have cruised to a plaque with simply an average rest of his career, started just nine games for Colorado, missed his age-32 season with injury, and was never the same pitcher afterward, receiving less than two percent of the vote when he eventually became a candidate. And the latest notch in this purple-and-black belt is Ubaldo Jimenez. To date the franchise's leader in pitching WAR, and whose career at present has a very convincing argument to be the best by a Rockies pitcher, Jimenez was eligible to get votes this year, and was instead left off the ballot. It's funny, isn't it? Anyway, that's a super depressing way to open the first one of these things this year. Hey! ""Ubaldo"" is a pretty weird name, right? How'd a guy with that name even make the Majors?

When Ubaldo Jimenez was just 16, the New York Mets offered him $20,000 to leave the Dominican Republic and play in their minor league system. The dream of so many children in his home country had finally come true for him, and he was about to embark on a journey to the big leagues. At least, that's what would've happened if Ubaldo's mom hadn't laid the hammer down and told him he had to finish his homework first. ""Graduate high school before signing any contracts,"" she said, probably in Spanish since she's Dominican. So the Mets offer got rejected. Turns out, that extra year of school paid off, because the Rockies offered him a $50,000 contract after he received his diploma. Let that be a lesson kids, diplomas multiply your starting salary by 2.5 times. His first couple years in the minors saw him go from ""meh"" in the rookie leagues in '02 to ""oh"" in Asheville in the single-A South Atlantic League in '03 to ""oh ho *ho*"" in high-A and double-A in '04. Even though '05 and '06 would be less kind to him, he still wound up at the end of all that as a 22-year-old pitcher who was holding his own at AAA. Those don't grow on trees, especially when those trees belong to a franchise who plays their home games a mile above sea level. Also helped that Jimenez simply did not allow home runs, with just 44 of them surrendered over his 552-inning minor league career. If I had to guess, that was the stat that made the Rockies' upper management think ""how bout we let that kid start the last game of our season?"" And so they did. After a tune-up MLB relief appearance a couple days prior just to make sure he was ready, Ubaldo Jimenez started his first MLB game at Wrigley Field on October 1st, 2006. And the Rockies higher-ups liked what they saw. In 6.1 innings, Jimenez struck out 3 batters, walked 3 batters, and only allowed 3 deep fly balls. One of those left the field, but that was off the bat of Aramis Ramirez, who'd hit 37 other dingers that season, so it was forgivable. In fact, when Jeremy Affeldt came in in relief, Jimenez would leave the mound having allowed just six baserunners the entire game. While it did end in a loss, that didn't matter. Colorado had finished the season allowing 812 runs, the fewest they'd ever allowed in a full 162-game season. If guys like Todd Helton and Matt Holliday could help their offense pick up next time, maybe even get some contributions from that Troy Tulowitzki guy they called up, things could get really interesting in 2007. Then things got really interesting in 2007. And Ubaldo Jimenez was right in the middle of a team in the level right below it. After some less-than-stellar outings in spring training and some more less-than-stellar outings with the triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox, he wouldn't return to the roster until some rotation juggling in July meant he got called up. Pays to play at such an altitude and not give up home runs, I guess.
 
Jimenez was joining a team that couldn't exactly figure out what it was just yet. While he was a Sky Sock (I think that's the singular form?), Colorado's record had gone from 18-27 to 38-34 to 39-43 to 48-46, which became 48-47 after his first start of the year. Jimenez figured ""when in Rome,"" and appeared unable to figure out what exactly he was. His time in the majors started off with three well-pitched games, then he allowed 11 combined earned runs in his next two starts, only to toss six innings of shutout ball with nine strikeouts the next time. Then he tried to psych the baseball gods out by allowing more home runs away from Coors (4) than he did at Coors (3) over his next 10 starts. Thankfully for him, while the jury was still out on what exactly Ubaldo Jimenez was, the Colorado Rockies had finally figured out who they were. And what  they landed on was a good baseball team. After Jimenez suffered a pretty bad 10-2 loss to the Florida Marlins on September 15th, the Rockies decided they didn't like losing games like that, and weren't gonna do it anymore. So they didn't. That 76-72 team finished the year 89-73, and then Matt Holliday didn't touch home plate, but sent them to the playoffs anyway. And since Jimenez was already one of the better arms in the rotation, he got to start Game 3 of the NLDS. The 16th start of Ubaldo Jimenez's career was in the playoffs. It was against the NL East division champion Philadelphia Phillies, whose lineup featured 2006 NL MVP Ryan Howard and eventual 2007 NL MVP Jimmy Rollins. It was at Coors Field. Jimenez was 23 years old. And he *killed it*. After the sixth inning, the score stood at 1-0. Jimenez was responsible for the 0. He'd allowed just one Phillies runner to touch third base, and had watched the ball leave the infield just five times. Shane Victorino's homer in the seventh may have made it six times, and he did get pulled after allowing a seventhe time to Carlos Ruiz immediately after that, but after Jeff Baker plated the Rockies' second run in the bottom of the eighth, Colorado was officially moving onto the National League Championship Series for the first time in franchise history. And the second Rockies pitcher ever to start an NLCS game was a 23-year-old in his 17th career start. Surely Jimenez would crack under pressure here, right? Think again. Five innings, one run, six strikeouts. Perhaps most impressive of all, out of twenty-three batters faced, just seven provoked the attention of the outfield. Jimenez left the mound with the Rockies leading, 2-1. While it'd be another no-decision for him, Colorado did prevail in extra innings, and went on to pull off a second straight sweep of their playoff opponent. Unfortunately for both Ubaldo and the Rockies, their World Series appearance against the Red Sox proved that while they had decided to be a good baseball team, they had not decided to be the best baseball team. Boston won all four contests in that year's Fall Classic, and took home their second piece of metal in four years. Even still, Jimenez's Game 2 start was far from a stinker. Four-and-two-thirds innings, only three hits allowed, and for the second straight game, only seven of the twenty-three batters he faced got the ball past the infield. He would take a hard luck loss, but he was facing Curt Schilling and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway in the World Series in his 18th career start, and I doubt there are many who could've done better given the circumstances. While the Rockies had to regroup that offseason and figure out how they could continue to be a good baseball team going forward, one rather overlooked development of the postseason would help that decision along. Because, even though it had taken eighteen starts at the Major League level, Ubaldo Jimenez had finally figured out what he was, and what he was going to be. And that would turn out to be, quite possibly, the best pitcher to ever don a Colorado Rockies uniform.

Over the next three years, Ubaldo Jimenez went from staff curiosity, to staff member, to staff ace, to staff superstar. His arsenal of pitches featured sinking motion that rivaled the *Titanic*, meaning he induced loads of ground balls and weak contact. If he wanted to, he could also put batters away with his four-seamer that touched 100 mph on occasion. And he rode that combo to three years of unprecedented success as a Rockies pitcher. His first year in the rotation would be the standard affair of any fourth starter on a normal MLB team. 12-12, 3.99 ERA, 3.85 FIP, 1.435 WHIP, 11 home runs allowed, 103 walks, 172 strikeouts in 198.2 innings. Nothing fancy. Except, that is, when you play half that season's games at Coors Field, in which case it nets you 3.8 bWAR, the 11th best total ever achieved by a Rockies pitcher at the time. Colorado, thinking ""this kid looks pretty good,"" decided to extend him through 2012 with a couple option years tacked on. Jimenez said yes, and, perhaps to show the team had gotten a good deal, turned it up a notch in 2009. Not content with his prior numbers, Jimenez bested almost every single number from his previous year. 15-12, 3.47 ERA, 3.37 FIP, 1.229 WHIP, 13 home runs allowed, 198 strikeouts to 85 walks in 218 innings. Now that's what I'd call a good year. Unless it was done as a member of the Colorado Rockies, in which case it is what I'd call a phenomenal year. 5.5 bWAR, good for 3rd on the all-time list. Also went to the playoffs, which was fun until it wasn't. But despite all this, the baseball world had not seen anything yet. Because they had not borne witness to the Ubaldo Jimenez they were set to behold. For in the 2010 season, he wasn't just good. He wasn't just great. He wasn't just phenomenal. He was one of the best pitchers in the sport. 

A record of 19-8. A 2.88 ERA. 3.10 FIP and 1.155 WHIP. 214 strikeouts in 221.2 innings. Just 10 home runs allowed. All this while pitching for the Colorado Rockies. THE. COLORADO. ROCKIES. Pitching success in Denver up to this point had been the result of either environmental benefit or dumb luck. Pedro Astacio earned 5.9 bWAR as a Rockies pitcher despite a 5.29 ERA because he played in a pre-humidor, offensively-exploding environment. Marvin Freeman got Cy Young votes in 1994 after a 2.80 ERA resulted from a weak contact approach that promptly never worked again after that year. Jason Jennings had won Rookie of the Year in 2002 despite a 4.52 ERA because *that was really good for a Rockies rookie pitcher*.  To have sustained success like this, to be one of the best pitchers in the game while toeing the rubber of Coors Field for half your starts, was not simply unheard of. Its invocation was more likely to be heard in a comedy routine than a Sportscenter panel. And yet, Ubaldo Jimenez wasn't laughing. He was dominating. He threw the first no-hitter in franchise history in his fourth start of the year. He won the NL Pitcher of the Month Award in April, then did it again in May for good measure. He woke up on June 1st with an ERA of 0.78 and only five more baserunners allowed (75) than strikeouts thrown (70). He not only made that year's All-Star Game, he started it. N Rockies pitcher had ever done that before, and none have done it since. He earned 7.5 bWAR, at the time far and away the most by a pitcher in franchise history. He came in third in NL Cy Young voting, the best finish ever by a Rockies pitcher. And none of it was good enough to take his team to the playoffs. Despite boasting that Jimenez guy and two top-5 MVP finishers in CarGo and Tulo, the 2010 Colorado Rockies did their best to mirror the 2007 Colorado Rockies. They turned an 82-66 record into an 83-79 record in thirteen easy steps. Step one, lose. Step two, lose. Step three, you get it. And when you share a National League with six teams who eclipsed 86 wins, 83 ain't gonna cut it. After that, because of the inevitability of the calendar, 2011 came. That year, it was as if the realization that he could not do it alone sapped Ubaldo Jimenez of all his magic. He was still good, but he wasn't *Ubaldo* good. After his Opening Day start set him up with an ERA of 7.50, some bad bounces and erratic throws meant it took him a complete game shutout on the first day of June to get it under 5.00. Alarm bells began sounding again on June 12th. That day, he allowed three home runs in a single game. This was not Ubaldo. The prior three years, he'd been, no exaggeration, the very best in the league at preventing home runs. His HR/9 of 0.479 over those three years was ranked first in the league among starters over that time. A Colorado Rockies pitcher accomplished that. And then, in just 5.1 innings, he allowed three of them. And one was a grand slam. While the next several weeks saw Jimenez throw some much better games, including an 8-inning 1-run showing against the Nationals, some rumors came to a head shortly before the trade deadline. Between overtaxing his arm, disgruntlement with being on an often floundering team, and things left unsaid by both Ubaldo and Rockies upper management, a rift had formed between Jimenez and those signing his checks. Then, at the trade deadline, the Rockies were 51-56, and Jimenez was doing well enough to look attractive to someone else, so Colorado struck while the iron was hot, and dealt the best pitcher in the history of their franchise to Cleveland. The face of their pitching staff, the 27-year-old who had delivered the best pitching anybody in Denver had ever seen, was gone, and in exchange they'd picked up three prospects and a player to be named later. The PTBNL, former fifth overall pick Drew Pomeranz, turned out to be the best player coming back the Rockies' way. That is not a good sign for how it worked out for Colorado. After more than a decade of time in the Rockies organization, Jimenez would be playing for another team for the first time in a long time. How'd that go?

The 2011 Cleveland Indians weren't your typical deadline team. A month into the season, they had the best record in baseball at 20-8. Since then, they'd brought themselves right back down to .500, sitting at 53-52 when Jimenez was acquired. Jimenez was once again a member of a team that hadn't figured out what it was. And much like he had the previous time he was part of such a team, he responded in kind. Though he just started 11 games for the Indians, the only thing you could be sure of with him was that you didn't know what you were getting. From five runs in five innings including a homer to eight innings and no earned runs to getting pulled after ten outs where he gave up eight runs and two long balls to seven innings of one-run ball with ten strikeouts. And that all happened in just his first month in the new city. Both Jimenez and the Indians finished the year with noncommittal records around .500, going 4-4 and 80-82, respectively. What's more, Jimenez had allowed 7 home runs in his 11 starts for his new team, a rate that was worse than any of his full seasons in Colorado. It was almost like he'd gotten so used to doing everything on the advanced difficulty, that when it went back down to normal, he didn't know what to do. Lucky for him, he'd get an entire season to figure it out in 2012. Only problem was he was still on a team that didn't know what it was, and we all know how that works out for him. The Indians entered the All-Star Break with a 44-41 record, and finished the year with a 68-94 record. Jimenez followed suit, entering the All-Star break with a record of 8-7 and finishing the year at 9-17. While he strung together some respectable starts in the first couple months, the wheels came off right around the time everybody else on the team decided to suck. He finished with a 5.40 ERA and 5.06 FIP, both way higher than he'd ever had with the Rockies. In fact, if you could name a stat, 2012 was probably his worst year for it at this point. Most importantly, he'd allowed 25 home runs, a total almost twice the worst it had ever gotten during his time in Colorado. And in his age-28 season to boot. Eek. That offseason, both the Indians and Jimenez had to decide what they were. You know what goes a long way in figuring out what your team should look like? Hiring Terry Francona. You know what else really helps? signing Nick Swisher and Michael Bourn. If your team does that, it's trying to win. And since Jimenez had done that before, he was going to help.
 
2013 was another up-and-down year for the Indians. They dropped 10 of their first 15, then just like that, they were 26-17 in mid-May, then another poor stretch dropped them to 30-33. However, with Francona at the helm, there was no question where Cleveland was setting its sights. In the blink of an eye, it was the end of July, and the Indians were sitting on 59 wins and 48 losses. This record had been accomplished by a bullpen that did what was asked of them, offense that showed up when it was needed, defense that got the job done, and a rotation built almost entirely out of nobodies and castaways that, as a unit, was one of the most effective in the league. While none of Cleveland's regular starting pitchers finished the year with an ERA below 3, none of them finished with an ERA above 4.05 either. Justin Masterson, an okay-to-pretty-good starter acquired from Boston several years prior, tossed three shutouts and was an All-Star that year. Scott Kazmir, who had an ERA above 5 in an independent league in 2012, put together a respectable 10-9, 4.04 ERA season for Cleveland in 2013. Corey Kluber and Zach McAllister, who had both been acquired in deals nobody remembered, turned in 24 starts each. And the lowest ERA among all of the starting arms belonged to Ubaldo Jimenez. The reclamation project had been fulfilled, and at the end of the year, the Indians' record sat at 92-70, which put the team in a playoff spot. Jimenez's 13-9 season featured a 3.30 ERA, 3.40 FIP, 1.330 WHIP, 194 strikeouts, and 16 home runs allowed. Also went 4-0 in his six starts in September, allowing just 5 earned runs while striking out 51 in 41.1 innings, which helped him win AL Pitcher of the Month. He was back baby. Sadly, the guy who was back wouldn't get the chance to pitch in the postseason. Because of this funny little thingamajig called the AL Wild Card game, the Indians' hopes for a deep playoff run hinged on the outcome of a single game against the Tampa Bay Rays, and after nine innings and zero runs, those hopes were dashed. The start went to young upstart Danny Salazar, who suffered the loss. Man, I really think Jimenez deserved a chance to be in that Wild Card game. Things probably would've turned out differently had he come out of the bullpen or something. Oh well. While Cleveland hoped to regroup and run it back, something important had to be dealt with: Ubaldo Jimenez's contract was up. After he exercised his option to test free agency after 2013, the Indians would need to pony up if they wanted to retain Jimenez's services. But with the dwindling attendance numbers, and upper management who were bigger fans of dollars and cents than good ball players, they didn't. So he went somewhere else.

Something I've noticed with many of the guys who have been left off the ballot in past years is that they will get a major payday and then turn in a performance best described as ""just okay."" That's more or less what happened to Ubaldo Jimenez. After leaving Cleveland, he received a 4-year, $50 million deal from the Baltimore Orioles. And, at least for the first couple years there, he looked... fine. Not great, not good, not even like Ubaldo Jimenez since he allowed 34 home runs in 46 starts. Just, fine. And you know, fine is better than nothing. Stephen Strasburg is getting paid way more than that to do nothing, and Patrick Corbin is getting paid way more than that to do even worse than nothing, so there are definitely ways this could've been worse. The thing was, the Orioles weren't paying for him to be fine. They were paying for *Ubaldo Jimenez*. The guy who could throw a no-hitter for the Colorado Rockies. Who could go on a tear out of nowhere and get you into the postseason. And what they got in 2014 and 2015 was fine. 18-19, 4.39 ERA, 4.22 FIP, 1.422 WHIP, 284 Ks in 309.1 innings. That's fine. But fine would not do. Because, possibly for the first time in his career, Ubaldo Jimenez's energy as a starter did not match the energy of the team he was a part of. These Baltimore Orioles weren't fine. They were great. 96 wins and a trip to the ALCS great. Four different players getting MVP votes great. And Ubaldo was just fine? Get with it, dude. However, what the team would come to realize was, rather than play for the Orioles of the present, Jimenez was playing to match the energy of the Orioles teams of the near future. Because the teams in 2015 and 2016, while reaching 80 wins in both seasons, could not inaccurately be described as ""fine."" Mediocre run differentials, rotations that inspired cautious optimism as opposed to confidence, and offenses that amounted to rallying around a couple big bats and hoping for the best. One place the team did wind up excelling was the bullpen, particularly in 2016. While Jimenez was too set on the future to concern himself with the present, throwing up a season of 8-12, 5.44 ERA stuff, another Oriole pitcher named Zack Britton was taking the baseball world by storm. From the beginning of May to the end of the season, Britton pitched in 58 games, and allowed exactly one (1) earned run. By the end of the year, he had put together one of the best relief pitching seasons the league had ever seen, period. No question about it. And thanks in part to his heroics, the Orioles found themselves in a Wild Card spot, and got to play for their lives in a one-game playoff versus the Toronto Blue Jays. An exciting back-and-forth game wound up tied at 2-2 after nine, and went to extra innings. Prime time for Zack Britton to shine. And yet, pretty much everyone reading knows that that's not what happened. Because, for whatever reason, after he'd exhausted all his other good bullpen arms, manager Buck Showalter decided to call one Ubaldo Jimenez in from the pen for the 11th inning of a tie game. If he'd struck out the side, he may well be on the ballot today. But he didn't. Instead, Devon Travis singled to left, Josh Donaldson did the same, and Edwin Encarnacion parked one into the left field seats at Rogers Centre for a 5-2 walk-off Wild Card win for the Blue Jays. And it was at that moment that Ubaldo Jimenez's career was over. 

Did Jimenez deserve to have this black mark be the thing he is known for? In my opinion, no. It should, I think, lay entirely on the shoulders of Buck Showalter. While it appears most fans do allocate the blame in that manner, I also believe Jimenez has, for lack of a better term, been ""Bucknerized."" Bill Buckner had an impressive career outside the thing everyone knows him for, and while the hindsight given to us by WAR does show he wasn't all that better than the average, he still displayed enough skill to regularly play Major League Baseball for over 20 years. Jimenez finds himself in a similar situation after the 2016 Wild Card Game transpired. While, yes, most people grew to see Showalter as the reason this happened, I have heard it argued that ""Buck wasn't the one throwing the pitches."" That is true. It's also not the issue. The fact of the matter was, Britton never took the mound when he should have. Jimenez took the mound when he shouldn't have. The man responsible for that inaccuracy should be the one people get mad at. Anyway, rant over, back to the end of Ubaldo Jimenez's career. It took him and the rest of baseball one more year to figure out, that the cleats should be hung up but when your age-33 season ends with a 6-11 record, the most earned runs allowed in the league, and 33 home runs allowed when your name is Ubaldo Jimenez, I'm sorry, but it's time to call it a career. And so, he did. Jimenez quit baseball after that season. He never formally announced it or filed the retirement paperwork, but he did not play professional baseball in any capacity for several years after 2017. Instead, he did something that he'd promised his mother he would do: worked toward a college degree. First a diploma to play baseball, and now a bachelor's to not play baseball. Would that we would all have mothers we respected so thoroughly. After a Rockies comeback bid in 2020 was stalled by COVID-19, Ubaldo Jimenez graduated in 2021 from Florida Tech with a B.A. in Business Administration and Management. After all, you gotta be real smart to make hitters not hit home runs at Coors Field.
 
I'll admit, I was not surprised to see Jimenez got stiffed by the Screening Committee. If I had to pick a primary reason for it, I think it's because he's not best remembered as the guy with quite possibly the best career as a Rockies pitcher, nor is he remembered as the guy who threw the first no-hitter in Colorado's franchise history. In the current baseball landscape, he is remembered as not Zack Britton. And Not Zack Britton doesn't get a checkbox on a Hall of Fame ballot. But honestly, I think Not Zack Britton deserved a chance. Heck, for all his history, he might even have earned a vote from a nascent voter who grew up a Rockies fan. Do we really think the voters would simply pass by the name of the first person to truly figure out how to pitch at Coors Field? I guess we'll never know.

Jimenez would visit the Hall in a Rockies cap for his, like, everything with them. On his visit, he'll be able to see something that's only been in the Hall for a short time: someone with the Rockies logo on their plaque.","baseball",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/z76hdy/the_ones_left_off_1_ubaldo_jimenez/"

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| There's 2 ways to look at the last week- either the Pacific has scam ass cold water giving us a tough time on road trips, or the Rays wanted to practice playing in close exciting games. Maybe the A's were extra hyped for their protest, maybe the padres thres us off by also having colorful neon sleeves. Whatever the case there's a much needed homestand before fording west again. |**51-24**
**2**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**+1**| The Braves went 6-1 this week against two teams that they should have gone 6-1 against, but the way they did it was spectatcular. Multiple come from behind victories scoring 51 runs (7.3 per game!) with the least total scored in a game being 5. Money Mike has started to figure it out, Eddie Rosario loves June (both with 8 HRs in the month so far) and Bryce Elder, not Strider, is our Cy Young candidate. The downside last week? They also gave up 4.3 runs per game. No doubt we can MASH with our MLB leading .818 OPS and 126 HRs as a team, but we need get some stability from our SP from guys not named Elder or Morton. This upcoming series with the Phils should be a lot of fun. |**46-26**
**3**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**-1**| I'm telling you, Corey Seager is as cracked as he is jacked. I saw him at a QT the other day buying Monster and adult diapers. I asked him what the diapers were for and he said ""they contain my full power so I don't completely shit on these kids"" then he buckled a customers legs with a homer and sprinted out the door. |**44-27**
**4**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**0**| Tough series against the Cubs, but I was surprised to see the Orioles are 7-3 in their last 10. They haven't seemed to be as potent as they were in the beginning of the year and the loss of Mountcastle can be seen in the lineup, however they continue to win games when needed. They also have not been swept in a series in over a year, which was also a little surprising. This team is on pace for exactly 100 wins, which in the AL East might be good enough for the top wildcard spot. |**44-27**
**5**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**0**| D-backs had a rough week, losing three out of four to the Phillies before winning a series against the Guardians. A series win against the Guardians might sound like a good thing, but the Snakes were routed in the final game, as starting pitching continues to be a glaring flaw.  |**43-29**
**6**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**0**| The Dodgers celebrate Fathers' Day by failing to show up and disappointing me this week, going 2-4 and dropping behind the Giants in the division after a hugely disappointing series with some weird plays. As a tough week against the Angels and Astros lays ahead, the Dodgers team ERA currently ranks at 25th in the League which raises the question: Who is this man wearing a Mark Prior skin suit coaching our pitchers? Has anyone checked him out?  |**39-33**
**7**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| Another frustrating week for the Astros that was capped off by being swept by our old NL Central friends, the Reds. I suppose this was revenge for all the dominance Roy Oswalt exerted on them once upon a time. Anyway, all's well that ends well, so with 90 games left in the season, there's not much sense in acting as though every game is life and death. |**39-33**
**8**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**+2**| Soooo, yeah. Last week I talked about this great new guy I picked up on the rebound, Zach Neto. What a hell of a few weeks it was. Notice I say *was*. Wasn't it just yesterday he was clocking 94.3 MPH throws across the diamond? Where did it all go wrong? Why are obliques even a body part to begin with? I know I am an incoherent mess right now, but I thought this time was different. He was...just so perfect. Heartbreak after heartbreak after heartbreak. Do you know the toll it takes on a man to watch Andrew Velazquez, Jose Iglesias, or Andrelton Simmons dick around at the plate season after season after season just because the team **has** to have someone at shortstop? The collection of Angels shortstops has looked more like the ridership of a short bus. Sure, David Fletcher was fire in the (spread) sheets for a spell there, but he just couldn't keep it up. Oh, Zach. I thought I was treating you right. I know things can be a little awkward at first, but we were patient and moved past those few growing pains and it was so good...until it wasn't. Please come back. :'( |**41-33**
**9**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**+6**| Okay, well, that was largely awesome. BroomEmoji, BroomEmoji. But it would be cool if every game wasnt interrupted by Radar saying CHOPPERS! and Giants fans collectively hoping Hawkeye is sober enough to operate. Or if that joke is too old for you, substitute Dr. Green. Still old? Hmm, the lady from Greys Anatomy? Im lying; I actually know her name and can discuss, in detail, every romantic mistake she has made. Im not saying the Giants are banged up, but I just checked MLB AtBat and it said In play, Day-to-Day.  Regardless of who has working limbs, the Giants are winning as consistently as people have sex in the elevator in Greys Anatomy. And trust me, if you shined a black light on that elevator you would be disgusted. The whole hospital barely even heals anyone  its mainly various hook up rooms and people more thirsty than the Giants with RISP. And dont get me started on Station 19  the Giants bullpen puts out more fires than that station. Its just more people banging. The whole city of Seattle is apparently just hot humans who cant keep their hands to themselves. Unrelated, next up is the Padres and DBacks in a pretty tough stretch. As hot as the Giants are, fans should be happy if they get through these next 7 games with 3 or 4 wins. |**39-32**
**10**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**-2**| The Yankees just got swept by the last place in Red Sox. Granted last place in the AL East is still a .500 ball club, but that doesnt excuse the absolute bludgeoning the Yanks took. This team looks lost, and as much as its easy to say its because theyre missing Judge, thats a half-truth at best. Theyve hit to a .298 OBP so far, putting them in the conversation with some of the most feared lineups in baseball, like the uh&.As, Tigers, and Royals. *Woof* |**39-33**
**11**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**|  |**39-34**
**12**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**0**| What a month of june for the fish its been, so far theyre 12-4. With an overall record of 41-31, this marks the first time weve been this high over .500 since 2011. Theres questions about how long of a leash eury perez is gonna have since this is his first season but time will tell. With how banged up our starting pitching is i wouldnt be surprised if he gets a bit of leeway but ill be shocked if we see him pitching in late september. We got the jays and bucs coming to miami this week. |**41-31**
**13**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**+6**| WOOOOOO! The Phillies go 6-1 on their West Coast roadtrip, with their one loss being feet away from a win. Finally beating the Diamondbacks when they're good vs. always losing to them when they're not as good is nice. A weird series in Oakland with two one run games will be 3 wins in the standings, no matter how we got there. The pitching has finally stepped up, with Wheeler going 19 1/3 IP and one ER over his last 3 starts and Taijuan Walker looknig like his best possible self with 20 IP and one ER in his past 3. The question remains as to whether the Phillies will upgrade at a corner infield spot or their 5th starter. Andrew Painter began throwing off of a mound for the first time but is still far from returning, and this team can only handle so many Matt Strahm/Dylan Covey/Bailey Falter starts when every game matters. This week, a classic NL East homestand with 3 against the Braves and 3 against the Mets. |**38-34**
**14**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**+2**| lol yankees |**37-35**
**15**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**-4**| The eternally .500 Twins had another 3-3 week. We're all waiting for the lineup to stop striking out and start clicking so we can finally get some distance between us and the rest of the AL Central. |**36-36**
**16**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**-2**|  |**37-34**
**17**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**0**| Randy Arozarena has to be my favorite non-Padre player right now, stemming from his play in the WBC for Mexico, and he made very classy play that Id never seen before in the MLB, on Friday night. When he attempted to steal a base, he was initially called safe, but the Padres quickly chose to review it. Everyone in the park saw the replay, where Randy touched Kims cleat rather than second, showing him clearly out. Rather than waiting for the official ruling to be overturned (The review crew was taking their sweet time with it), he simply started walking back to the dugout before the official ruling changed. Randy had a 3-run bop later in that game, so it didnt exactly hurt him. The Padres did win the series however, and dont look now, but the Padres have had a 12-7 record since their series with New York. |**35-36**
**18**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**0**| Two series wins this week as the .500 seesaw continues to go up and down. The M's face a tough stretch from now until the All-Star Break, with four series against AL playoff contenders. But maybe this is a blessing in disguise - do well and they're right back in the thick of the race, do poorly and Trader Jerry can start shopping out some rentals. Up next: 3 @ Pinstripes, 3 @ Oreos |**35-35**
**19**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+3**| The Reds are winning a lot right now. Im happy. But I dont want to get overconfident. I got a lot of questions: Is this sustainable? Can our bullpen continue its dominance? Will our inability to consistently hit home runs come back to bite us? Will Elly De La Cruz live up to potential? Will I ever sign these divorce papers ive been staring at for 2 weeks? I just have a lot of questions going through my mind about this team. Have you ever got that feeling that something just isnt right? Cause I have that feeling with the Reds. Something has to be going on. Are we really just good again? Do you know what I mean? Like that feeling you get when youre doing something and you suddenly just become&aware? As if your mind becomes keenly aware of its own existence for like 30 seconds and your vision and hearing clears and you begin having a mini panic attack as you dart your eyes around your room? You know the feeling Im trying to describe? Maybe it hits you as you lie in bed and its 2 AM, and all of a sudden youre thinking about your death, and you become scared. Whats after death? When I die is it just nothing? Now youre alone in bed and youre scared. Is death it? Will anything I do matter? Whats the point in anything when if I die it all goes away? All there is is emptiness, except emptiness doesnt even exist, its completely indescribable. Maybe your mind goes to your mom and dad, theyll be dead soon, ill never be able to talk to mom and dad again. Your heart races and you try to think of something else to pass the time, but youre getting older. Your death is coming soon too. I dont want to die, I dont want everything to go away, I never did anything, maybe Ill live forever, I just dont know it yet. Guys Im freaking out, what if death is just the end of everything, all my memories, all my experiences, everything ive ever done I wont remember cause I simply wont be anymore. I dont want this, Im scared. This is what the Reds being good again has done to me. I dont know if I can take it. |**37-35**
**20**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**-7**| This past week went about as bad as it possibly could, with the Pirates getting swept in Chicago and Milwaukee. The Bucs are now under .500 and are closer to fourth place than first. At least top prospect Henry Davis is finally getting the call to the majors  how convenient that he was suddenly ready for the bigs shortly after the Super 2 deadline passed.  |**34-36**
**21**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**+2**| The Cubs had an excellent week, going 5-1  against the Pirates and Orioles highlighted by Justin Steele's return. They are suddenly 7-2 in their past 9 games and only 4.5 games behind the Brewers for the division lead. This week, they travel to Pittsburgh before heading to London to play the Cardinals. The Cubs need to maintain their recent form to stay in the NL Central Race  |**33-38**
**22**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**-2**| After a great week with series Ws over the Red Sox and Astros, I was optimistic. Then I got brought back to Earth. The Guardians had an embarrassing series against the Padres. Then we lost our first two against the Diamondbacks, which was disappointing, but not unexpected. Then we had a great game against the Diamondbacks in the series finale. Where was that all week? In other baseball news: I hope the Reds ranker is enjoying the team's recent success. And wtf has happened to the Dodgers and Athletics? |**33-38**
**23**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**-2**| We're 33-38. Our bullpen seemingly needs to throw 8.2 innings a game because of our decrepit rotation. Pete Alonso came back faster than expected from his wrist injury, but it was at the expense of Mark Vientos who was never given a fair chance to produce. I was told that adding the DH to the NL would lead to more excitement and offense but all I've gotten is a bunch of ABs where Daniel Vogelbach never takes the bat off his shoulders then strikes out looking. If the Mets can't right the ship in the coming weeks, look for them to be light sellers at the deadline. |**33-38**
**24**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**| Nootbaar's back, Walker's hitting. Fire John Mozeliak. |**29-43**
**25**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+3**| Nothing quite like taking on the leader of your division on the road and winning three of four to knock the Twins down to .500. I propose in lieu of awarding a playoff berth to the winner of the AL Central, we should send another ALE or ALW team into October because this division has some serious stank. This week: 3 vs KCR, 3 vs. MIN. |**30-40**
**26**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**-1**| Please, White Sox, I'm begging you. Choose a lane. Either shorten that 5.5 game gap in the central or just fall out of it so I can emotionally divest myself of this season. Although I admit I am more invested in this than most fans as I write this on my phone from my hotel at coaster con. |**31-42**
**27**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**-1**| Nats stick, but we knew it going into the year. They've been especially bad in the last few weeks but the expectations are the floor so just need them to be semi-competitive and show promise. When's the trade deadline again? |**27-43**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**-1**| We don't talk about what the Rockies pitching staff just did in Atlanta. |**29-45**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS4cyDLYmG0 |**19-52**

"2022-11-06",1667741448,"Obit: At approximately 11:33pm local time last night The 2022 MLB season passed away in Houston, Texas","Heartbreaking news out of Texas last night, as the 2022 Major League Baseball season passed away at the far too young age of seven months old. Although the season was going strong as recently as the first week of October, it experienced a dramatic drop in available teams to continue it's life source shortly after, and was diagnosed with Terminal Post-season.

2022 tried to hold on until the very last moment, but it could not overcome an additional diagnosis of what experts are referring to as ""Framberilization,"" a condition that makes bats limp and shortens games by increasing outs at an alarming rate. 2022 seemed to overcome the condition by bouncing back in game three, but then became further weakened by the ""Javier Flu,"" and a  second bout with Framberilization just one day later proved too much to bear.

The 2022 season was quite popular and beloved by many, and condolences flooded in shortly after.

""We may have come in last, but 2022 made sure that New York's best chance of happiness now comes down to the Giants or Jets, and for that we will always love it,"" wheezed Boston.

""It gave us hope and a reason to believe in God again,"" reported a teary-eyed Baltimore

""I would literally run through that weird fucking brick wall covered in gum for 2022,"" wailed a sobbing Seattle.

""I mean, I won't say I was *actively* rooting for it to di-"" began Anaheim, before being quickly interrupted for a breaking weather report.

Although we all collectively mourn the loss of 2022, we can all take solace in the undeniable truth that it died surrounded by tens of thousands of loved ones, with millions more across the world having it in their thoughts.

2022 is survived by an intense longing for homeruns flying deep into the hot summer night, celebratory trumpets, on ongoing discussion about roofing, a lingering distaste for umpires, and an absurd assumption that Joey Gallo will bat .300 without the shift.

RIP, 2022
