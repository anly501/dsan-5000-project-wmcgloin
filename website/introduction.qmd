# Introduction to the Hot Hand

## Prior Research

## The Debate

## what I am exploring

## 10 Questions

1. What data is available for my topic? 
2. What does current literature on the topic argue?
3. How can I build off of the current research and approach the topic in a novel way?
4. Should I limit the scope of my topic to sports or can I expand past that? 
5. How should I define success? (the concept of the hot hand is that success breeds success)
6. What is the best way to visualize the data? 
7. Do athletes and/or the public believe in this phenomenon? 
8. Is there any evidence that the hot hand exists? (prior research states that "demonstrations of hot hands per se are rare and often weak due to various reasons"[^1])
9. Does the hot hand impact strategy of a game? Should it impact strategy? 
10. If the hot hand does exist, in what sport (or area outside of sports) is there the most evidence in support of the phenomenon?
